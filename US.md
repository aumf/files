# Fact-checking and debunking the list of alleged atrocities & conspiracy theories of the United States Government
[The Bullshit asymmetry principle, or Brandolini's law](https://www.nature.com/articles/540171a):
> The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.

The goal of this research project is to challenge, disrupt, and subvert the dominant narrative meme in online pop-culture circles, the general public and yellow journalism. By providing an authoritative, meticulously documented resource as a invaluable 'living document' that officially fact-checks and outright refutes allegations made by political pundits and conspiracy theorists, from across the political spectrum. This correction and refutation is achieved via a close, critical examination of primary source records—as well as peer-reviewed, scholarly literature from world-leading experts in their corresponding fields. The issue with lists that claim to archive US "atrocities" is that they're created often by conspiracy theorists,<sup>[[1]](https://imgur.com/a/ipTt002)</sup></sup> who predominantly cite sensational headlines/alt media that are written by persons who either have strong biases, and/or simply lack familiarity with the subject matter to understand nuance and key information that'd be adverse to their world-view. These lists simply do not stand up to rudimentary factual or legal scrutiny. Established academic consensus on these fields isn't as widely accepted/known among the general population. It has become sort of a counterpublic. A tragedy that is the result of decades of disinformation and constant propaganda. Truth-decay must be stymied.

Some readers will find this repository clash with what they think they know to be true, and as a result, may commit a number of logical fallacies in order to deal with the cognitive dissonance. It is encouraged to read the material from a fresh canvas. 

A note on sources: This repository only cites peer-reviewed, mainstream academic literature from world-leading scholars, that form a consensus in various fields, respectively. It also cites authoritative contemporaneous records to events, rather than, say, cable reporting. Other primary source records include a multitude of independent investigations carried out by various oversight bodies that overlap in findings (forming a clear consensus of fact) and have withstood the test of time. These documents are always far superior to other accounts (such as news papers, NGOs, etc due to the fact they're conducted by expert investigators, who interview and cross-reference all relevant testimony, and examine the full documentary record—thus leading to a deeply penetrating, critical investigation. Further, many such oversight reports also include a review of open-source material, to be as thorough as possible. They, of course, written by people like you and I, and are not infallible. Often, when such investigations are erroneous, they're re-examined in other follow-up reviews that address the previously identified issue. In almost every such record, you'll find a highly self-critical, and impartial investigation. Some herein shown for the first time, and others, while public for many years—were forgotten to time.

Not all governments are equally transparent or accountable.

__Disclaimer:__ This project isn't an attempt to whitewash or deny when actual atrocities, or wrong-doing by the US Government, has occurred. One can simply look at racial segregation, slavery, or the early treatment of natives, as some examples (hence not covered here). However, by and large, the US has maintained a very good track record on human rights. When it falters, accountability swiftly follows.

- "There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge." - Isaac Asimov

- “Most people would rather die than think and many of them do!” ― Bertrand Russell, The ABC of Relativity 

- "Around the world, the United States has promoted freedom: We have worked to expand the protection of human rights, end gender-based violence, and defend the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and the press. In promoting these liberties and pushing back against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, we have recognized that universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. They are the birthright of people everywhere." – President Barack  Obama, Presidential Proclamation - Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2016.

- "The American commitment of policy and of faith is roughly this: We are dedicated to the proposition that the revolutionary process of modernization shall be permitted to go forward in independence, with increasing degrees of human freedom. We seek two results: first, that truly independent nations shall emerge on the world scene; and, second, that each nation will be permitted to fashion, out of its own culture and its own ambitions, the kind of modern society it wants. The same religious and philosophical beliefs which decree that we respect the uniqueness of each individual, make it natural that we respect the uniqueness of each national society. Moreover, we are confident—or we are prepared to gamble—that, if the independence of this process can be maintained over the coming years and decades, these societies will choose their own version of what we would recognize as a progressively representative and open society. We are also prepared to gamble that the resulting societies will recognize the advantages of economic and other forms of international cooperation with like-minded nations elsewhere."  -  December 1961 report by the Counter-Guerrilla warfare Task Force<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP89B00552R000100040002-3.pdf#page=24)</sup></sup>

## Alleged Imperialism
- It has been alleged that the US maintains an "imperialistic network" of over 800 military bases in 70 countries. This is misleading and in factual error: Site: A specific geographic location that has individual land parcels or facilities assigned to it.  Physical (geographic) location that is, or was owned by, leased to, or otherwise under the jurisdiction of a DoD Component on behalf of the United States.  A site may be contiguous to another site, but cannot geographically overlap or be within another site. A site may exist in one of three forms:  land only– where no facilities are present; facility or facilities only– where there the underlying land is neither owned nor controlled by the government, and land with facilities –where both are present. Installation:  A military base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, including leased space, that is controlled by, or primarily supports DoD’s activities. An installation may consist of one or more sites. The DoD has presence in only 45 countries, for a total of only 514 sites as of 2018. This is at the full consent of host countries.<sup>[[1]](https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/BSI/Base%20Structure%20Report%20FY18.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TIF-2020-Full-website-view.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- US Military presence abroad is popular among locals of host countries, where economies and stability increase.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/outside-the-wire-us-military-deployments-and-public-opinion-in-host-states/BEC8A7BA48C9CF5B82B100CCC4CFA56E)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR518.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095327X17738219?ai=1gvoi&mi=3ricys&af=R)</sup></sup>

- A 2023 study found, "analysis of coups from 1951 to 2019 demonstrates that the presence of US troops decreases the likelihood of a coup."<sup>[[1]](https://academic.oup.com/fpa/article-abstract/19/1/orac027/6916934?redirectedFrom=fulltext)</sup></sup> 

- A comprehensive 2014 study revealed, "the United States is likely to engage in military campaigns for humanitarian reasons that focus on human rights protection rather than for its own security interests such as democracy promotion or terrorism reduction... the present research finds that, beneath the greater consciousness concerning promotion of democracy and combating terrorism, human rights abuses emerge as the consistent trait among states that experience US military intervention... The empirical evidence of this study leads us to believe that the United States has a sustained interest in promoting human rights abroad rather than exclusively pursuing its security interests. This finding therefore lends credence to the Liberal Hypothesis about human rights, especially in contrast to the Realist Hypothesis regarding terrorism. This finding is also in line with the official position of US Department of State: ‘‘The protection of fundamental human rights was a foundation stone in the establishment of the United States over 200 years ago. Since then, a central goal of U.S. foreign policy has been the promotion of respect for human rights, as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.’’ Of course, our assessment counteracts the widespread popular belief regarding US intervention as self-serving adventurism."<sup>[[1]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002714560350)</sup></sup>

- Over two years, a researcher "interviewed more than 130 officials about electoral interference. My interviewees included eight former CIA directors and many more CIA officers, as well as directors of national intelligence, secretaries of state, national security advisers, a KGB general, and a former U.S. president. I learned that in the twenty-first century, Washington’s senior-most national security officials have considered using the CIA to interfere in foreign elections at least twice. In one instance—in Serbia in 2000—debate turned into action, as the CIA spent millions of dollars working against the tyrant Slobodan Milosevic. In the other—in Iraq in 2005—the CIA stood down. In both instances, U.S. policymakers weighed the potential benefits of covert action against the perceived risks. These behind-the-scenes stories reveal why, contrary to Putin’s claims, Washington, unlike Moscow, has moved away from the practice of covert electoral interference."<sup>[[1]](https://news.yale.edu/2020/08/20/rigged-details-long-history-russian-and-us-electoral-interference)</sup></sup>

- Congress has in fact often authorized hostilities by legislative measures other than formal “declarations of war” since the days of the early republic, and many after the War Powers Resolution.<sup>[[1]](https://www.justice.gov/file/19306/download)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/WCPD-1999-03-29/pdf/WCPD-1999-03-29-Pg527.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Contrary to popular myth, nations (yes, including the US) have not initiated war over oil. Many scholars have found evidence to support the myth lacking, and contrary evidence to explain decision-making. Examining a century of interstate violence, she demonstrates that, at most, countries have engaged in mild sparring to advance their petroleum ambitions.<sup>[[1]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2016.1171968)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501748288/the-oil-wars-myth/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/978-1-137-55631-8)</sup></sup>

## Middle East

- It has been alleged that the US sanctions medicine, among other humanitarian aid, to Iran—however, America has never sanctioned humanitarian aid, ever.<sup>[[1]](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/iran-sanctions)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.state.gov/iran-sanctions/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/details?prodcode=RS20871)</sup></sup>

- On May 3, 2023, the United States conducted a counterterrorism air strike in Northwest Syria targeting a senior Al Qaeda leader. Soon after the air strike, reports surfaced the strike may have resulted in a civilian casualty. The investigation, which concluded on November 15, 2023, was conducted by Investigating Officer, Brigadier General John P. Cogbill, U.S. Army, and supported by a team of ten senior service members and civilian employees not directly involved with the strike with extensive subject matter expertise in intelligence, law of armed conflict, operations, and targeting matters. The investigative team received both cognitive bias training and red team training. The team conducted site visits in the United States, Iraq, and Jordan, and interviewed more than forty witnesses. The investigative team also sought information from non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The team reviewed classified and unclassified information held by DoD and other federal agencies. The investigation determined U.S. forces misidentified the intended Al Qaeda target and that a civilian, Mr. Lutfi Hasan Masto (Masto), was struck and killed instead.  the investigation concluded the strike was conducted in compliance with the law of armed conflict as well as Department of Defense and CENTCOM policies.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240625003513/https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/3763291/may-3-2023-investigation-findings/)</sup></sup>

- Afghan intelligence units, referred to as "zero units," with alleged connections to the CIA, have been target of a massive, "systematic disinformation campaign designed to discredit them because of the threat they posed to Taliban rule.” As noted above, CIA has a "direct role in applying pressure to foreign Governments and individuals to abide by human rights, otherwise face consequences such as termination of cooperation." And that, "the CIA has followed through on its word, due to CIA's concerns."<sup>[[1]](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160713_cia_brennan_transcript.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/150806%20DCIA%20Brennan%20letter%20to%20Wyden[2].pdf)</sup></sup>

- On Sept. 29 2022, the Department of Defense reported 12 civilian deaths and approximately five civilian injuries in its Annual Report on Civilian Casualties in Connection With United States Military Operations for 2021. Deaths and injuries from Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) in Iraq and Syria, Operation Freedom’s Sentinel in Afghanistan, and U.S. Africa Command activity in Somalia. Civilian deaths in Afghanistan comprised the entirety of reported deaths for 2021, amounting to 12 killed and two injured, while the department reported no deaths and three injuries in Somalia. According to the report, there were no deaths or injuries in connection with U.S. military operations in Iraq or Syria, though it did update its estimate for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to include an additional 18 injured and 10 killed as a part of the Combined Joint Task Force OIR—an operation meant to counteract activities of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in Iraq and Syria.<sup>[[1]](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/27/2003086234/-1/-1/1/ANNUAL-REPORT-ON-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-IN-CONNECTION-WITH-UNITED-STATES-MILITARY-OPERATIONS-IN-2021.PDF)</sup></sup>

- On the 1st of August, 2022, the US carried out a successful drone strike against Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan.

- On February 3rd, 2022, US troops conducted a raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. Civilians were killed as a result of him detonating a bomb, killing his family. US Special forces had tried to call for his surrender and offered him a path to survive.<sup>[[1]](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/NEWS-ARTICLES/News-Article-View/Article/2927256/mckenzie-says-isis-leader-who-died-during-us-raid-was-evil/)</sup></sup>

- On December 18, 2021, NYT released hundreds of CIVCAS reports obtained through FOIA. Despite media coverage, a close examination of the files reveals nothing new, broadly. But does offer superior information into specific strikes media/NGOs either covered (or didn't). The core conclusions are reached upon a thorough review of the files: Most CIVCAS allegations were self-reported, long before or even with no media coverage; vast majority of CIVCAS allegations coming from media/NGOs were off be a large order of magnitude, in: Dates, locations, and assessed number of people killed/injured, and causes. Most had no CIVCAS, buttressing official statements; confirms findings in CIVCAS reviews that SOPs, doctrine, policy, and laws (domestic & international), etc were followed in both dynamic and deliberate strikes. From strike authority to CIVCAS mitigation efforts.<sup>[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/civilian-casualty-files.html)</sup></sup>

  Contrary to media allegations, the July 18, 2016 airstrike in Tokhar, a village in Manbij, Syria did not cause the deaths of 80 to 160 civilians. While the exact number is indeterminate, pre-strike footage confirms possibly 7 to 24 civilians. All ROEs and IHL were adhered. Nor negligence or wrong-doing. <sup>[[2]](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/c-7-18-16-syria/6187433f42585e2f/full.pdf)</sup></sup> Further, counter to the list's claim that, "The reports reveal that the US military deliberately chose to drop bombs on children they saw on camera... knowingly bombed children playing on a roof." The underlying internal document shows that children were observed the day before the strike—and that no children were seen prior to pre-strike soak of target. Only one child was wounded. Those killed were all adult ISIS. Most likely family of the child.<sup>[[3]](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/c-1-30-17-iraq/6747b75e76514e83/full.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  Indeed, a world-renowned expert, Professor Brian Cox, conducted a deep, critical analysis of the NYT series, and other media coverage. In reality, it is the sensationalist media who lacks any accountability. "The critical analysis conducted herein casts doubt on the claim that NYT reporting genuinely has revealed that combat operations are beset by systemic flaws in intelligence or targeting procedures.  Nonetheless, it is the “scant accountability” angle of both the “Civilian Casualties Files” story, and indeed the compilation of recent high-profile NYT coverage of U.S. military combat operations abroad, that is misleading and, therefore, of dubious character. In cultivating the “scant accountability” narrative, relevant NYT stories routinely misstate the standards by which personnel are actually held to account in reality. The narratives habitually draw upon commentary of unascertainable credibility and authority presented by unnamed sources as well as expert opinions from identified sources with a discernible ideological bias. The cultivated journalistic narratives emphasize details and commentary that appears to contradict official characterizations while also selectively disregarding factors that repudiate the validity of the preferred “scant accountability” theme. In doing so, the favored narratives and sources draw conclusions from insufficient data and evidence. Likewise, doctrinal sources of law and policy that actually do apply to combat operations are either not represented at all or, when they are described, are profoundly mischaracterized."<sup>[[4]](https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1132&context=clsops_papers)</sup></sup>
  
- On December 2, 2021, an independent Inspector General review, dated May 2021, was declassified, it found CENTCOM's kinetic targeting procedures (intelligence vetting, Civilian Casualty mitigation, and approval authority) were adhered to, in operations in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Libya.<sup>[[1]](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Dec/10/2002907413/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2021-084%20(REDACTED).PDF)</sup></sup>

- In November and December 2021, the New York Times published two articles alleging a cover-up of a war crime regarding a March 18, 2019, airstrike in Baghouz, Syria, claiming over 80 civilians were killed. Critics argued that the articles contained numerous red flags and omitted CENTCOM's comprehensive statement that contradicted their claims. Following this reporting, Secretary of Defense Austin appointed a Four-Star General to conduct an independent review with 20 experts, analyzing 124 documents, 25 reports, and 29 hours of video footage.

  The review concluded that on March 18, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were under attack from ISIS and had requested Coalition air support, believing no civilians were present in the target area. The U.S. Ground Force Commander (GFC) validated the hostile intent of ISIS and authorized airstrikes, unaware that civilians were within the blast radius, leading to civilian casualties (CIVCAS). Several factors, including the altitude of the U.S. ISR platform, environmental conditions, and the use of a VISCUT filter, hindered the ability to identify civilians accurately. The findings indicated that the GFC acted reasonably within the Rules of Engagement and demonstrated concern for civilian casualties, taking steps to mitigate harm. The New York Times made several allegations against Task Force 9 (talon anvil), claiming it falsified records, redirected drone cameras just before strikes, and excluded the Baghouz incident from DoDIG-2021-084. However, the review found no evidence of misdirected sensors, affirming that ISR feeds were essential in concluding that civilian casualties (CIVCAS) occurred on March 18, 2019. DoDIG-2021-084 did not mention the Baghouz incident because it had not been finalized by the time the report was completed, and it focused primarily on procedures for training and reporting CIVCAS.

  The review also noted that the mIRC chat logs used by Task Force and CENTCOM were stored on a secure server and could not be altered, which was consistent with other investigation findings. It also noted that a seperate IG report, 2019-074 recognized areas for improvement, it found no evidence to support claims  made by two CIA personnel of intentional concealment or obfuscation. The appearance that that it wasn't taken seriously/covered-up by the person who raised a complaint is explained, "the original review of the incident to determine whether the allegations of CIVCAS were credible and the AR 15-6 investigation report were both submitted after their respective deadlines. In addition, although the incident was reviewed and investigated, administrative steps to close the incident and thereby cause it to be included in reports to Congress did not occur." The review found that there were 73 casualties. 52 enemies were killed in action. Of those 52, 51 were adult males, one was a child. Two enemies were wounded in action. Both were males. Four civilians were killed, one female and three children. And 15 civilians were wounded 11 women and four children.<sup>[[1]](https://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2021/11/15/the-law-the-baghuz-airstrike-and-accusations-of-a-possible-war-crime-and-cover-up/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/2844585/us-central-command-statement-to-correct-the-record-from-capt-bill-urban/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/baghouz-strike)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/garrett-report-and-addendum)</sup></sup>

- On August 29, 2021, US forces conducted an airstrike in self-defense; believed to be an imminent ISIS-K threat to Hamad Karzai International airport. Immediately after the strike, CENTCOM issued a statement that acknowledged possible CIVCAS, before any local or international media reported on it, "We are assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties, though we have no indications at this time."<sup>[[1]](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2756206/us-central-command-statement-on-defensive-strike-in-kabul/)</sup></sup> A follow-up statement that same day said, "We are aware of reports of civilian casualties following our strike on a vehicle in Kabul today... We are still assessing the results of this strike..."<sup>[[2]](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2756293/update-us-central-command-statement-on-defensive-strike-in-kabul/)</sup></sup> 
  
  On September 17, an independent investigation was completed. It found, "The initial compound from which the Toyota Corolla came from is a confirmed ISIS-K facility. Rocket attacks came from there, among other intel (post strike), upholding this assessment; 60 sources of intel were coming in, indicating a white Toyota Corolla would be used for an attack; 6 drones in total, over 8 hours, observed the movements; The secondary explosives reported in post-review seem to indicate propane tanks detonated to the rear of the vehicle; Weaponeering was completed to mitigate CIVCAS, such as delayed fuse, making sure no assessed civilians were near, etc. All ROEs were followed on the time-sensitive target. An initial CIVCAS review was initiated within 24 hours of the incident. This was not prompted by the NYT article."<sup>[[3]](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2780738/general-kenneth-f-mckenzie-jr-commander-of-us-central-command-and-pentagon-pres/)</sup></sup>

- On June 27, 2021, President Biden, authorised US Military defensive precision airstrikes against facilities used by Iran-backed militia groups in the Iraq-Syria border region. The targets were selected because these facilities are utilized by Iran-backed militias that are engaged in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq. Specifically, the U.S. strikes targeted operational and weapons storage facilities. These strikes were legal under US domestic and international law. 0 civilians were killed.<sup>[[1]](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2672875/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/)</sup></sup>

- On June 3, 2021, the US Department of Defense released its annual civilian casualty report pursuant to Section 1057 of the 2018 NDAA, as amended. The report covers Calendar Year 2020 for Global Military operations. It assesses that in 2020, US Military operations resulted in 23 civilians killed and 10 injured. The report also updated the Department's previous casualty numbers from prior years. The DoD assessment is based off of all NGO, media, and foreign Government submissions, self-reporting, etc. Its methodology is superior to that of NGOs, as it relies on classified and sensitive methods to determine casualties, including footage before, during, and after each incident. The Department is also transparent in updating prior reporting to increase the numbers, should new credible information be discovered. The new report details the near completion of two independent studies required by Congress.<sup>[[1]](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jun/02/2002732834/-1/-1/0/ANNUAL-REPORT-ON-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-IN-CONNECTION-WITH-UNITED-STATES-MILITARY-OPERATIONS-IN-2020.PDF)</sup></sup>

- In 2013, Obama issued formal rules and SOPs for High Value Target capture/lethal action missions, outside areas of active hostilities. This was called the Presidential Policy Guidance (PPG). This was followed under the Trump administration with the Principles, Standards and Procedures (PSP) guidance. Contrary to sensational reporting, it did not lower any standards to protect civilians. Like the Obama guidance, it keeps intact layered oversight and bureaucracy. Contrary to such inaccurate media reporting, as the declassified PSP reads, "The law of armed conflict imposes important constraints on the ways in which the United States uses force abroad. Direct action will be discriminating and precise in order to avoid noncombatant casualties. The United States goes to extraordinary lengths to reduce the likelihood of noncombatant casualties in CT operations, exercising restraint as a matter of policy that often exceeds what is required by LOAC. Direct Action should be undertaken wherever practicable and consistent with US interests and applicable domestic and international law. The United States will continue to take extraordinary measures to ensure with near certainty that noncombatants will not be injured or killed in the course of operations, using all reasonably available information and means of verification." This guidance, to, was revised under President Biden, called the Presidential Policy Memorandum (PPM). It maintains the same standards as both the PPG and PSP.<sup>[[1]](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/trump-psp-drone-strike-rules-foia/52f4a4baf5fc54c5/full.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23867592-presidential-policy-memorandum?responsive=1&title=1)</sup></sup>

- On October 9, 2019, United Nations Mission Afghanistan released a report claiming US forces illegally struck drug facilities, resulting in civilian casualties. This report was discredited for citing Jihadi propaganda websites, its deeply flawed legal examination, etc. From the response: "United States Forces — Afghanistan (USFOR—A) disputes the findings, legal analysis, and methodology of the UNAMA report released. USFOR—A is concerned by the way UNAMA reached its conclusions and disagrees with their mischaracterization of the Taliban in the methamphetamine production facilities; their reliance on sources with conflicted motives or limited knowledge (including the Taliban propaganda website "Voice of Jihad"); and their narrow definition of legally targetable combatants. By the time USFOR—A decided to conduct precision strikes, intelligence and operations professionals knew what the Taliban narcotics production facilities looked like, exactly where they were and who was allowed entry. USFOR—A and partner organizations also knew the pattern–of–life for their operations and locales. Under US legal definitions and rules and policies governing the conduct of war, and after exhaustive and comprehensive review of the facilities and those running them, USFOR—A and partner entities determined personnel in the labs were members of the Taliban and lawful military targets. USFOR—A deliberately chose the targets and the timing for the strikes to avoid non-combatant casualties, striking during the daylight hours to maximize the ability to obtain and share site pictures which ensured we could verify the absence of civilians. On the day of operations, USFOR—A observation of the targeted sites used multiple surveillance platforms, including aircraft with full-motion video gathering capabilities. USFOR—A pre-strike processes included scores of hours of scrutiny of targeted sites to ensure we could verify non-combatants were not present. USFOR—A had degrees of certainty required at the time of the precision strikes to assess forces were only striking legal targets and avoiding non-combatant casualties and collateral damage. USFOR—A even declined to strike nearly a dozen production facilities due to even a slight possibility for civilian casualties. The investigations leading to the identification and characterization of these methamphetamine production facilities, their ownership and oversight by the Taliban, the internal rules allowing entry only to Taliban combatants, as well as the flow of funds from these locations to Taliban operations, were combined operations with Afghan security partners. These operations against these Taliban revenue sources were planned and developed over the course of a year, drawing upon the expertise and resources of a wide array of interagency and inter-governmental organizations and relying upon extensive intelligence collection."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/USFORA-airstrike-response)</sup></sup>
 
- In September 2019, a US drone strike targeted Da'esh terrorists in Nangarha province, according to Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Media alleged that 30 civilian farm workers were killed in the strike.

- On the 1st of April, 2018, US forces received fire from Al-Shabaab fighters in the vicinity of El Burr, Somalia. They called in an airstrike. This was the kinetic end to the months-long target development of a HVT target. An independent review found the strike followed established operating procedures to mitigate civilian casualties. Initially, it was assessed no civilians were killed. However, further review of full motion video determined that a female and child had entered the target vehicle. All ROEs and Laws of War were followed.<sup>[[1]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24136502/attachment-3-2-2019-202-responsive-record.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/31697/u-s-africa-command-commander-directed-review-reveals-civilian-casualties)</sup></sup>

- Starting in June 2017, photos and videos from Raqqa, Syria claiming to have shown alleged US-backed groups "illegally" using white phosphorus.<sup>[[1]](https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/06/12/u-s-led-forces-accused-using-white-phosphorus-syria-iraq/)</sup></sup> While it's hard to say who was deploying it—mere use of WP is not a war crime. U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon told the Washington Post that the U.S. military only uses white phosphorus in “accordance with the law of armed conflict” – for example “for screening, obscuring and marking in a way that fully considers the possible incidental effects on civilians and civilian structures.” Other Coalition forces have used WP in this manner before, in other countries: Talking to NPR, New Zealand Brig. Gen. Hugh McAslan said, "We have utilized white phosphorus to screen areas within west Mosul to get civilians out safely." Many experts have provided breakdowns of the legality of WP—confirming it isn't a chemical weapon, and lawful to use.<sup>[[2]](https://www.lawfareblog.com/jus-bello-white-phosphorus-getting-law-correct)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/08-2006.pdf)</sup></sup>

- A comprehensive, independent study from NDU, assessed US air and artillery strikes conducted in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, between January 2015 to December 2017. The study pulled experts from Think Tanks and within the DoD, as well as establishing an NGO advisory panel. It consisted four components: 1) A literature, legal, and policy review; 2) analyses of quantitative data: strikes, civilian casualties, and US military assessments of civilian casualties; 3) semi-structured interviews with operators analysts, headquarters staff, and senior commanders, and 4) Roundtable discussions with NGOs.<sup>[[1]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7048479-2018-Civilian-Casualty-Military-Study.html)</sup></sup> It reached four main findings: "The delegation of Target Engagement Authority did not directly cause an increase in the rate of CIVCAS during OIR; there is clear written guidance and oversight regarding civilian casualty mitigation for deliberate and dynamic strikes. There is also widespread priority to minimize civilian casualties from the highest to lowest levels; commanders throughout the chain of command exercised thorough oversight. These findings are consistent for declared theaters with Operating Principles that authorize direct action and Areas of Active Hostility, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Somalia, as well as Outside Areas of Active Hostility and the Positive Identification process has sufficient guidance and structure and therefore does not increase the risk for civilian casualties." The review also found that US strikes rarely peaked above a dozen CIVCAS over the 3 year period per month.
    
- On March 16 2017, in al-Jinah, Syria, US forces stuck a building where AQ and Syrian militant groups were meeting. An investigation, which combined NGO reporting and all other evidence found that the struck resulted in minimal damage to a little Mosque next door. This airstrike resulted in a single civilian injured. The Target Engagement Authority was unaware the smaller building was being built as a Mosque. This was due to intel analysts shift changes, etc. Thus, the approve chain would have been different for the strike. UNHRC issued a fatally flawed report on Syria, that found this airstrike likely in violation of IHL. However, world-leading scholars have refuted the report, which misapplies International law, and thus reaches an erroneous conclusion.<sup>[[1]](https://www.lawfareblog.com/unhrc-commission-inquiry-syria-misapplies-law-armed-conflict)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/al-Jinah)</sup></sup>

- A study by two world-leading experts concerning Iraq and Afghanistan US operations concludes, "We analyzed two sets of data dealing with these wars: the first, from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), details all founded investigations alleging serious law of armed conflict violations in Iraq and Afghanistan by Sailors, SEALs, and Marines; the second, from the Army Court of Criminal Appeals (ACCA), details all cases of alleged serious law of armed conflict violations by soldiers referred to court-martial. The NCIS data indicates that ninety-two allegations of serious law of armed conflict violations were substantiated, thirty-seven of which led to courts-martial (a number of others received non-judicial punishment), and twenty-eight of which resulted in conviction. The ACCA data shows 100 referred cases, of which seventy-eight resulted in conviction on at least one offense. Many of these cases resulted in substantial sentences, including life imprisonment."<sup>[[1]](https://www.lawfareblog.com/should-us-military-receive-benefit-doubt-when-investigating-itself-alleged-war-crimes)</sup></sup>

- Contrary to sensational media allegations, US forces did not strike the Syrian dam on March 26, 2017. US forces struck the towers near the dam, used by ISIS. These towers are not connected to the dam. Further munitions used were non-cratering munitions. No civilians killed/injured, and no damage to the dam occurred, according to documents obtained by NYT.<sup>[[1]](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/nc-3-27-17-syria/bff38494ffb87814/full.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.centcom.mil/Portals/6/Documents/Transcripts/28MAR%20CJTFOIR%20GEN%20Townsend.pdf?ver=2017-03-31-075531-900)</sup></sup>

- On March 17 2017, a US airstrike accidentally killed 112 civilians in al Jadidah, Mosul. Again, Unknown to Iraq & US forces, ISIS was holding onto civilian hostages. Also, unknown to Iraq and US forces was the presence of additional munitions that resulted in a secondary explosives effect. Again, targeteering, and other CIVCAS mitigation efforts were all present to avoid civilians and collateral damage to the surrounding buildings. Forensic analysis confirms it was the secondary explosives that ISIS owned, that caused the civilian deaths.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/mosul-ar-15-6-investigation)</sup></sup>

- A 2017 report, requested by Congress, examined between FY 2011–16, finds that the US investigated all allegations of human rights abuses committed by Afghan forces, including child abuse reports made externally and internally, as best they could and cut off aid to those units implicated. Convictions were landed on those who committed the crimes. The report does find some issues, and the agencies involved have their comments at the end. There wasn't a consolidated process, and as US forces drew down—they lacked the insights they once had into abuse allegations. "SIGAR found no evidence that U.S. forces were told to ignore human rights abuses or child sexual assault. Following the establishment of the State and Defense Leahy Vetting Procedures for the Afghan National Security Forces in July 2014, and a biweekly joint DOD and State Afghanistan Gross Violation of Human Rights Forum (Leahy Forum), the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSD-P) began to track gross violation of human rights incidents—including child sexual assault—that were reported to and considered by the Leahy Forum. According to data provided by OUSD-P, as of August 12, 2016, the office was tracking 75 reported gross violation of human rights incidents. Of these reported incidents, 7 involved child sexual assault, 46 involved other gross violations of human rights, and 22 were classified at a level above Secret because of the sensitivity of the information or the sources and methods used to obtain the information. These incidents ranged in date from 2010 through 2016, and included gross violations of human rights allegedly committed by Afghan security forces within the MOD and MOI. The incidents reported to and considered by the Leahy Forum came from a variety of sources including intelligence reports, news articles, U.S. forces, and the Afghan government. Of the 75 reported incidents in the OUSD-P tracker, 7 involved allegations of child sexual assault—1 that the Leahy Forum found to be credible, 5 that remain under review, and 1 that was found not credible. Five of the seven involved MOI units, and two involved MOD units. The one credible incident was reported by the Afghan government. In this instance, the government reported that two ANA Special Operations Command (ANASOC) noncommissioned officers (NCOs) attempted to sexually assault a girl to coerce information from her mother. Following a trial, both NCOs were indicted and convicted for attempted sexual assault of a minor in violation of the penal code and sentenced to 6 years of confinement. Based on the information the Afghan government provided, DOD determined that it had credible information of a gross violation of human rights and began the process to remediate the unit. Also details improvements made on the Afghan side including legislative, as well as other high-level efforts by the US Government working with the Afghans. It found no evidence, as NGOs/media alleged, that US forces were told to ignore child sex abuse/other human rights abuses.<sup>[[1]](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/inspections/SIGAR%2017-47-IP.pdf)</sup></sup>
   
- On 28 January 2017, President Trump authorised a Special Operations raid in al-Bayda, Yemen. The raid was successful, though tragic, in its collection highly important information. Media and NGOs claimed that during the raid, a firefight killed as many as 30 or more civilians. This however, was a hoax. According to declassified documents obtained by the ACLU, show that high resolution footage (covering many Points of View), and sensitive intelligence, confirm between 4-12 civilian casualties, supposedly to include Nawar "Nora" al-Awlaki.<sup>[[1]](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/uscentcomfoia17-0328l_ocr_0.pdf)</sup></sup> Women also participated in the fight.<sup>[[2]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/5553400/Attachment-4-SOCOM-ARR-YEMEN-2.pdf)</sup></sup> Classified documents also obtained by the ACLU show the mission was authorised because it satisfied the NCV 0 policy.

- During the a battle in Boz Village, Kunduz, Afghanistan on Nov 3, 2016, Afghan Special Forces attempted to capture Taliban leaders responsible for the surge in violence that year. A small element of US troops were present to provide advice and assistance. Taliban forces opened fire from multiple buildings. US and Afghan forces were forced to request aerial fire support from U.S. platforms in self defense. Aerial fires were also used to suppress Taliban who were firing on U.S. medical evacuation assets as the dead and wounded were evacuated. Sadly, as a result of Taliban actions, 33 civilians were killed. An independent investigation concluded that U.S. air assets used the minimum amount of force required to neutralize the various threats from the civilian buildings and protect friendly forces. The investigation further concluded that no civilians were seen or identified in the course of the battle.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170520120301/http://www.rs.nato.int/article/press-releases/civilian-casualties-confirmed-in-boz-village-kunduz.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/nov-2016-boz-airstrike)</sup></sup>

- In 2016, Obama released, per EO 13732 Sec. 3, data concerning High Value Target CT missions Outside Areas of Active Hostilities. The first report covers from Jan 2009 to Dec 2015. It shows that there was a total of 473 strikes with a total of between 2372-2581 combatants killed and only between 64-117 civilians killed.<sup>[[1]](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Press%20Releases/DNI+Release+on+CT+Strikes+Outside+Areas+of+Active+Hostilities.PDF)</sup></sup> Following this, the 2016 report was issued, giving us: 53 total strikes. With 431-441 combatants killed and only 1 civilian killed. Both records make clear to refute the allegations that any "military-aged male" in area of target is deemed a combatant, or "retroactively" designated combatants. To quote, "Males of military age may be non-combatants; it is not the case that all military-aged males in the vicinity of a target are deemed to be combatants."<sup>[[2]](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Summary-of-2016-Information-Regarding-United-States-Counterterrorism-Strikes-Outside-Areas-of-Active-Hostilities.pdf)</sup></sup> For an overview of the domestic, international law and policy frameworks that guide US Military operations, especially as they relate to Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Libya and Somalia: See this 2016 compendium.<sup>[[3]](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Legal_Policy_Report.pdf)</sup></sup>

- From 2001 up to the present day, the drone campaign has resulted in disrupting many terrorist networks, and resulted in very few civilian casualties. Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the confirmation hearing for John Brennan, confirmed as a result of Congressional oversight, that the civilian deaths per year as a result of drone strikes is often in the single digits.<sup>[[1]](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/11331.pdf)</sup></sup> Lethal strikes are only sought if capture of HVTs is not feasible.<sup>[[2]](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download)</sup></sup> Leaked documents from the Intercept confirm that these missions (including ground raids) result in very few civilian casualties. From September 16, 2011 to September 16, 2012 in Afghanistan, out of a total of 2,082 missions only 14 civilians were killed or injured. That's 0.67%. Media have incorrectly claimed that these documents show a 90% civilian casualty rate from drone strikes.

From these, a picture starts to emerge: The “average approval time” for a proposed strike under the AUMF process was 79 days. Even excluding the single longest approval, presumably an unrepresentative outlier, the average was 58 days. The fastest approval was 27 days; These approvals were preceded by lengthy periods of gathering and analyzing intelligence on the targets—an average of six years; Four out of 24 proposed concepts of operations covered by the study were disapproved under the AUMF review process; The process for approving strikes under the AUMF “requires significant intel/ISR to justify (and maintain) approvals.” “Relatively few, high-level terrorists meet criteria for targeting” under this process. Further, the "drones cause blowback" talking-point has long been discredited in academic literature.<sup>[[6]](https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article-abstract/42/4/47/12192/Do-U-S-Drone-Strikes-Cause-Blowback-Evidence-from?redirectedFrom=fulltextl)</sup></sup>

- On 3 October, 2015, a United States Air Force AC-130 accidentally misidentified the Kunduz Trauma Centre, operated by Doctors without Borders. Per an independent investigation, "During the Period of Darkness (POD) 27 / 28 Sep 15, Taliban forces initiated a large-scale attack on Kunduz City (Kunduz). The Taliban moved into Kunduz in force and by the evening of 28 Sep, had taken over key locations within the city. All levels of US and Afghan commands were surprised at the speed and scope of the attack. USSF, along with multiple Afghan Special Security Forces (ASSF) units, fought their way from the airfield into the city. As conditions deteriorated in Kunduz, the MSF leadership contacted multiple US and ANDSF commands, providing the locations of MSF facilities in Kunduz, to include the Trauma Center. Multiple individuals at all levels of command were notified of the MSF Trauma Center's location via MSF or through the US chain-of-command. The MSF Trauma Center was also identified as a hospital in Department of Defense databases since Oct 14. On the night of 2 Oct, ASSF leadership notified the USSF ground forces of a pending ASSF operation into the city and provided the location of the ASSF's objective, an Afghan Government compound. The ASSF objective compound was 500 meters away from the USSF ground force position at the PCOP compound, and could not be seen from that location. That same night, an AC-130U Gunship flew from Bagram Airfield to support the USSF operations in Kunduz. The aircrew was alerted and launched 69 minutes early, due to a request made by USSF leadership. Due to the early launch, the aircrew did not have the typical information it would have on a mission. While enroute to Kunduz, one of the aircraft's critical communications systems failed, resulting in the aircraft's inability to receive and transmit certain critical information to multiple command headquarters. While loitering over Kunduz, the aircraft avoided a significant surface to air threat. In response, the Aircraft Commander took defensive measures that decreased the aircrew's ability to precisely locate targets on the ground. The aircrew navigator notified the JTAC that the grid plotted to a field, and the aircrew identified a large complex 300 meters southwest from the JTAC provided grid location provided. The navigator requested ground force confirmation that this was the ASSF objective. The JTAC conferred with the GFC, who conferred with the Afghans, who confirmed that the compound was the correct objective. The JTAC replied 15 seconds later that the large compound was the ASSF objective. The aircrew did not realize they were observing the MSF Trauma Center. The ground force and aircrew were unaware the aircrew was firing on a hospital throughout the course of the engagement."<sup>[[1]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2819730/RESPONSIVE-DOCUMENTS.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 2014, Congress created a new authority for the Department of Defense (DoD) to train and equip select Vetted Syrian Opposition (VSO) in the FY2015 NDAA. This authority, as amended by subsequent legislation, enables DoD “to provide assistance, including: training equipment, supplies, stipends, construction of training and associated facilities, and sustainment, to appropriately vetted elements of the Syrian opposition and other appropriately vetted Syrian groups and individuals.” Such assistance activities are authorized for select purposes, including supporting U.S. efforts to combat the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria and promoting the conditions for a negotiated settlement to Syria’s civil war. This was not to topple the evil Assad regime.<sup>[[1]](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33487.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.asafm.army.mil/Portals/72/Documents/BudgetMaterial/2023/Base%20Budget/Other%20Funds/CTEF.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2015-01-09_IF10040_6a40635108d535ccbb16a8f2d5622206017c03ce.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/FY2024/FY2024_CTEF_J-Book.pdf)</sup></sup> These groups are vetted to make sure they're in compliance with international law, and not associated with terrorist groups or individuals, extremist views, etc. Per the Leahy law, the US Government is prohibited from using funds for assistance to units of foreign security forces where there is credible information implicating that unit in the commission of gross violations of human rights (GVHR).<sup>[[5]](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PP410_INVEST_v2.1.pdf)</sup></sup> The training is not limited to military activity, but mandatorily includes promoting and educating the respect for the rule of law and human rights.

  It is alleged that the CIA provided weapons and training to some rebel groups who went onto join terror orgs.

That does not suggest they are working together at all.<sup>[[16]](https://web.archive.org/web/20220610014916/https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/Clinton_Email_October_Release/C05789138.pdf)</sup></sup> These conspiracy theorists also try to suggest a declassified DIA cable proves as such, but it doesn't even hint at such a thing.

  Further, some will try make a connection by citing press reports from December 2017, talking about the supposed findings from Conflict Armament Research—that various weapons from across the world, including the US, ended up in ISIS hands, as evidence of US support. Aside from the jump in logic. Per the CAR report, "weapons and ammunition recovered by the Lebanese Armed Forces on board the Letfallah II vessel, which Lebanon intercepted en route to Syria in 2012. Reportedly destined for the Free Syrian Army." It cites a 2014 UN report. Per the UN report, relying only on press accounts, "The December 2012 inspection of arms seized from the Letfallah II gave the Panel an insight into the type of materiel transferred from Libya to the Syrian Arab Republic..."  Most importantly, the UN report continues, "Some media reports claimed that United States officials working in Benghazi prior to the attack on the Benghazi consulate in September 2012 might have been involved in transfers of weapons out of Libya via Turkey to the Syrian opposition. The Panel contacted the United States regarding the claims, which it denied. To date, the Panel has found no evidence to support the allegations."<sup>[[19]](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2014_106.pdf#page=48)</sup></sup> 

  So no, no US connection at all. Indeed, worse for the conspiracy theorists, per a November 2014 independent investigation, "CIA was not sending weapons (including MANPADS) from Libya to Syria, or facilitating other organizations or states that were transferring weapons from Libya to Syria."<sup>[[20]](https://web.archive.org/web/20141206020557/http://askedandanswered-democrats.benghazi.house.gov/assets/answers/32.pdf)</sup></sup> Further, "The eyewitness testimony and thousands of pages of CIA cables and emails that the Committee reviewed provide no support for this allegation. From the Annex in Benghazi, the CIA was collecting intelligence about foreign entities that were themselves collecting weapons in Libya and facilitating their passage to Syria. The Benghazi Annex was not itself collecting weapons. The Committee has not seen any credible information to dispute these facts."<sup>[[21]](https://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/benghazi%20report.pdf#page=17)</sup></sup> This finding was independently verified by a 2016 review, "None of the witnesses or documents before the Select Committee provided evidence to contradict the HPSCI finding that “[t]he CIA was not collecting and shipping arms from Libya to Syria.”<sup>[[22]](https://web.archive.org/web/20180103231410/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114hrpt848/pdf/CRPT-114hrpt848.pdf#page=839)</sup></sup>

- On February 2012, in Afghanistan, 100 Qurans and other religious material were burned in an incinerator. Pundits claimed this was evidence of US disrespect for the culture in Afghanistan. However, an independent investigation found this wasn't so: "Because of suspicions that detainees were using library books to pass notes and messages, members of the 535th  Military Police and the Theatre Intelligence Group Team at the DFIP planned a search of the books in the library. During the search, one of the interpreters helping to interpret the notes and messages written in the books reported that approximately 60-75 percent of the books in the library also contained extremist content. A junior leader perceived that he had permission from his commander to remove the objectionable materials from the library, and the library search team began to separate texts for removal. A work detail loaded the books into a supply truck as part of the nightly burn pit run. During the loading process an Afghan National Army (ANA) Soldier and an ANA interpreter expressed concern about removing the books to US Service Members loading the books. Because the US  Service Members thought that the books were contraband, they disregarded the ANA and interpreter's cautions. The ANA Soldier and interpreter then  voiced their concerns to DFIP Operations, but by the time that Battle Captains in DFIP Operations figured out what was happening, the truck was already on its way to the burn pit. Many books were burned before a local national at the burn pit noticed that some of the books were Qur'ans. I do not find  that those involved acted with any malicious intent to disrespect the Quran or defame the faith of Islam, however. Ultimately, this tragic incident resulted from a lack of cross-talk between leaders and commands, a lack of senior leader involvement in giving clear guidance in a complex operation and poor adherence by US Service Members to established procedures. Clearly a decisive point in the events that took place that day was the segregation of religious books based on the advice of primarily one linguist who characterized the books as "radical" or 'extremist' in nature. Over-reliance on one linguist's interpretation of book content improperly influenced a series of decisions, resulting in a strategic crisis. Despite all the missteps, at no time was the path chosen by the involved US Service Members motivated by hatred or intolerance of a particular faith."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/quran-investigation)</sup></sup>

- Between 2012 and 2016, occasionally articles would appear alleging that US Special Forces (ODA 3124), while deployed to Wardak Province, Afghanistan in 2011, kidnapped, tortured and executed 15 civilians. These allegations were investigated several times, including a joint US/Afghanistan review. In 2015, the Criminal Investigations Division announced it would reopen their investigation. In 2022, that review was closed. The investigation independently corroborates past reviews. It determined, "USSF personnel did not commit the offenses of murder, detainee abuse, or kidnapping. The investigation included a thorough review of medical records,  patrol logs, story boards, and operational records and determined USSF personnel were not operating in the areas where the incidents occurred. The investigation by the Afghanistan Directorate of Security (NDS) determined Mr. Zekria Noorzai aka Kandahari, a former interpreter for USSF, committed the offense of murder, when he caused the death of Mr Sayed Mohammad by beating him. Mr. Zakria Noorzai was convinced of murder by the Afghan Lower Court and upheld by the Afghan High Court, in which he was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. Further investigation consisting of re-interviews of USSF personnel, support personnel and contracted persons  to ODA 3124 did not affirm or establish evidence of war crimes or atrocities committed by USSF personnel at COP Nerkh. Additional investigation consisted of coordination with the office of the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA)."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/wardak-cid)</sup></sup>

- A 2010 international group of experts, by the IAEA, reviewed four sites in Southern Iraq in which Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions were used in the 2003 conflict. The report finds that "the radiation doses from DU do not pose a radiological hazard to the population at the four studied locations in southern Iraq. The estimated annual committed effective radiation doses that could arise from exposure to DU residues are low, always less than 100 μSv/a and only to a few, if any, individuals, and therefore of little radiological concern. The estimated radiation doses are less than those received on average by individuals from natural sources of radiation in the environment (worldwide average 2.4 mSv/a), below internationally recommended dose limits for members of the public (1 mSv/a) and below the action level of 10 mSv/a set out in the IAEA Safety Standard on Remediation of Areas Contaminated by Past Activities and Accidents [1] to establish whether remedial actions are necessary... it is likely that the general picture is not very different at other locations in Iraq where DU was used in the 2003 conflict. The conclusions reached in international studies of other situations where DU munitions were employed (Kuwait and the Balkans) were similar to those of this report and support the belief that the radiological impact of the residues from the firing of DU munitions is also likely to be low in other parts of Iraq."<sup>[[1]](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1434_web.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 2010, Chelsea Manning leaked what became known as the 'Iraq and Afghan war logs.' It's worth noting that the vast majority of these leaks are in plain-text format. So, while the damaged caused was great—to SIGINT, GEOINT and HUMINT—which put civilians at risk from attack,<sup>[[1]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3868778/Wikileaks-Manning-Defense-Department-Damage.pdf)</sup></sup> the actual things that matter to the media was the CIVCAS numbers. Sadly, no one is able to independently verify and confirm the plain-text files released by wikileaks are accurate. Even worse, some stories don't even cite to the plain-text files on wikileaks site. The only thing that was leaked, that seemed to indicate wrong-doing by the US Military, concerned a video, that was dubbed "collateral murder." However, upon critical examination of the facts and law, no war crime occurred: On July 12, 2007, a US Apache helicopter was providing force protection to Bravo Company 2-16. The Company had been in near continuous contact from insurgents since dawn. The Apache spotted a group of armed men heading in the direction of Bravo Company. The Apache kept its eye on the group until one person peaked around a corner, knelt, and shouldered what appeared to be an RPG. Indeed, the leaked footage from wikileaks confirms this. After the Apache cleared the building, it was cleared to engage the insurgents. The second engagement was also lawful, as the van was assessed to be more combatants aiding the injured insurgents. No children were seen in the van. After the dust settled: Unknown to the Apache crew, all but two people turned out to be insurgents—they were two journalists with Reuters. It must be highlighted that these two journalists were not wearing the standard 'press' or 'media' vests, nor did they tell the military they'd be present in an area that had seen fighting for days on end. Among the bodies, there were RPGs, AKMs, and other weapons. There was no violation of the Laws of War or Rules of Engagement.<sup>[[2]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1506533/30-2nd-brigade-combat-team-15-6-investigation-pdf.pdf)</sup></sup> Manning was charged and convicted for a [number of crimes, none of which were political or in retaliation.<sup>[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20190304152646/https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/Apps/ACCAOpinions/ACCAOpinions.nsf/ODD/818BA3ADDACC08A28525829E0060B9B1/$FILE/oc-manning,%20be.pdf)</sup></sup>Further, just being shot and injured doesn't automatically make one hors de combat.<sup>[[4]](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/down-not-always-out-hors-de-combat-close-fight/)</sup></sup>

Initial observations did indicate a possible threat of force via weapons and tactical manoeuvring. Patience was displayed, allowing the situation to develop over several hours. However, miscommunication made it for naught. The miscommunication and misunderstanding occurred between drone pilots at Creech AFB, Nevada, screeners in Florida, and the command posts. The GFC acted within ROE, with the information he was presented, however, information that should have triggered a reevaluation were missed. Weapons were observed to be present prior to and during engagement.

- 12 February 2010 in Gardez District, Paktia Province, Afghanistan, news reports had claimed US Special Forces deliberately killed a pregnant woman, and covering it up. An independent investigation was ordered to answer two principle questions: Did the ground force deliberately mislead its higher headquarters in initial reports regarding this incident and did the ground force attempt to hide the circumstances surrounding the casualties by altering, tampering with, and/or cleaning up the incident scene? The investigation concludes that the answer to both of these questions is "No" and recommends no disciplinary action against the assault force members. The facts gathered in this investigation indicate that ground forces were unaware that the females were killed when they engaged Mohad Zahir after he emerged from a building in the compound with an AK-47 pointed at the assault force on the roof.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/gardez-15-6)</sup></sup>

- Contrary to the headlines, the Jan 2010 Maywand District murders were not the result of poor climate within Brigade, as a result of Col. Harry Tunnell's leadership. An independent investigation found, "no causal relation between the 5/2 SBCT command climate created and fostered by the 5/2 SBCT commander, COL Harry Tunnell, and the alleged criminal activity, including murders, alleged to have been committed by Soldiers from 2-1 Infantry Battalion. In fact, COL Tunnell appeared to place great emphasis on adhering to standards of the law of war and the rules of engagement (ROE). Furthermore, even given that COL Tunnell's emphasis on counterguerrilla operations appeared somewhat at variance with Army doctrine, that emphasis had minimal influence on Soldiers at the platoon level. Rather, the alleged criminal activity apparently occurred as a result of the acts of individuals within 3rd Platoon, B Company, 2nd Battalion, 1 Infantry Regiment (3/B/2-1 IN). While the alleged criminal acts may have been identified earlier or perhaps prevented with stronger presence by leaders immediately above those charged with crimes, no evidence that the alleged acts occurred as a result of the overall command climate set by COL Tunnell.

  Even COL Tunnell's most vocal critics stated that adhering to the Law of War/ROE and investigating possible violations and other serious incidents were two areas that he took very seriously and went to great lengths to enforce across the brigade. Soldiers within the SBCT generally understood the ROE. COL Tunnell and battalion commanders developed pocket smart cards, training scenarios, and training aides to assist Soldiers on the ROE during home-station training, NTC, and during their deployment to Afghanistan. Many of the Soldiers commented that the smart card that COL Tunnell directed every Soldier carry at all times and the battalion commanders' monthly tactical directives detailing Escalation of Force (EOF) lessons learned were very useful in enforcing ROE guidance. COL Tunnell directed every battalion to conduct monthly EOF and ROE training and report one-hundred percent completion to the SBCT TOC. COL Tunnell personally attended the monthly training with the members of his Assault Command Post (ACP). Additionally, COL Tunnell required all battalion and company commanders to ensure all Soldiers were briefed on and understood the ISAF Commander's tactical directives.All 4 men involved in the crimes were independently investigated, charged and convicted. Their sentence depended on their level of involvement: Morlock received 24 years in prison; Gibbs got life in prison; Holmes got 7 years prison and Winfield received 3.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/ar-15-6-investigation-5-2-sbct-asd-release)</sup></sup> 

- In 4 May 2009, Granai Bala Balouk District, Farah Province, Afghanistan—The Special Operations Marines (MARSOC) & Afghan SF units called in CAS with (4) F/A-18F strikes. Another (3) strikes were called in for a B-1B Bomber. Civilian casualties resulted because of the complex environment: "The use of military force in this engagement with the Taliban was an appropriate means to destroy that enemy threat within the requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).  However, the inability to discern the presence of civilians and avoid and/or minimize accompanying collateral damage resulted in the unintended consequence of civilian casualties. Throughout the conduct of this operation, the Ground Force Commander' s (GFC) ability to break contact was hampered by the effects of direct fire contact with a significant enemy force, a  lengthy effort to medically evacuate (MEDEVAC) U.S. and Afghan critically injured personnel by helicopter, and persistent, real-time intelligence on the enemy's continuing efforts to manoeuvre, mass, re-arm, and re-attack friendly forces from within the village. The independent investigation concluded that the Laws of Armed Conflict were followed. At least 26 civilians were killed. Around 78 Taliban were killed.

After successful infiltration, the Afghan/US team received hostile force engagement. They requested CAS. Unknown to both US & Afghan forces, the hostile engagement positions were in close proximity to civilians. Allegations that the US/Afghan forces committed violations of the Rules of Engagement or Law of War during the 21-22 August 2008 firefight resulting in 90 civilian deaths are unsubstantiated]. The first investigation concluded there was 6 civilians killed. Subsequent to new information provided by UNAMA, ICRC, etc, the US conducted another, more comprehensive investigation. It found that there were 33 CIVCAS and 22 anti-coalition  militants died. The independent investigation 28 interviews resulting in more than 20 hours of recorded testimony from Afghan government officials, Afghan village elders, officials from IGOs/NGOs, US and Afghan service members, 236 documents and 11 videos. It also found villager statements heavily inconsistent, and other severe methodological flaws by the NGOs and UNAMA. The second investigation also incorporated FBI forensic teams to aid its efforts.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/Azizabad-august-2008-MARSOC/mode/2up)</sup></sup>

- 4 March, 2007, Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, a MSOC-F (a unit of MARSOC, Marine Special Operations Command), "convoy was subject to a complex ambush. Small arms fire, and a Suicide Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device approached the convoy at a high rate of speed and detonated. The convoy defended against additional near-simultaneous attacks, quickly regrouped, and resumed movement west on Highway A1 using authorised procedures to disperse the crowds and unblock the road to allowing the convoy to continue its westward route. Within 30 minute of the blast, and the convoy's return to base, internet media reports began surfacing indicating that a coalition convoy had opened fir on civilians, killing and wounding many. An Air Force Colonel was appointed to conduct an investigation into the facts surrounding the incident. The Colonel ignored statements by those in the  convoy, ignored EOD specialists, and placed too much at face value on alleged witness testimony. Another investigation was appointed, a formal Court of Inquiry (COI) to independently determine the facts and circumstances relative to the actions of MSOC-F. After hundreds of interviews, a complete examination of the documentary evidence, the COI found the statements and testimony of the personnel in the MSOC-F convoy to be consistent, truthful, and credible. The COI found that MSOC-F Marines defended appropriately and proportionately against the 4 March 2007 enemy ambush, and that a non-governmental organization employee's unbiased testimony independently corroborated the testimony of the MSOC-F personnel. The COI opined that the findings and conclusions found in Col P's investigation run counter to the weight of the evidence considered by the Court. Additionally, Col P never interviewed the Reconnaissance Operations Center (ROC) Watch Officer on duty, nor did he review the ROC log to determine the sequence of events on 4 March to determine exactly what was reported and to whom it was reported. Based on his conclusion that the use of force applied by the personnel in the convoy was excessive, Col P recommended various personnel in the MSOC-F convoy be charged. Col P's investigation was discredited and the magnitude of his errors cannot be overstated. Col P was in possession of overwhelmingly clear evidence that MSOC-F was ambushed and responded in a discriminate and effective manner. Col P. suppressed exculpating evidence and inexplicably accepted the testimony of Afghans he stopped, apparently randomly, and questioned, making no effort to ascertain the location of the Afghans on 4 Mach 2007 and making no effort to corroborate their statements. Col P did not examine key locations, did not interview any of the Afghans allegedly injured by the Marines, and did not examine the ammunition logs." This is also known as the Shinwar shooting.<sup>[[1]](https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/galvin-pentagon-report-1549974003.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On March 15, 2006 in Ishaqi, Iraq, between 3-9 civilians were killed in an airstrike on a building that was later destroyed. According to an independent investigation, "Allegations that the troops executed a family living in this safe house, and then hid the alleged crimes by directing an airstrike, are absolutely false, the raid's ground commander had adhered to the rules of engagement."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20090913111715/http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=216&Itemid=21)</sup></sup>

- On November 19, 2005, in Haditha, Iraq: a patrol from Company K, 3d Battalion, 1st Marines (3/1), mounted in High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles(HMMWVs), was struck by an IED and received some small arms fire near the intersection of Routes Chestnut and Viper in Haditha, Iraq. The patrol suffered one FKIA and two FWIA as a result of the IED attack. During actions taken by the patrol in response to the attack, several Iraqi civilians were killed near the IED site. Following standard procedures of condolence payments sent to family of victims, reporting came in containing allegations of deliberate and wrongful killings by the Marines. On 14 February 2006, the MNC-1 Commander directed Colonel G.A. Watt to conduct an AR 15-6 investigation into the incident. The investigation concluded that there had been no intentional targeting of noncombatants; that overall, throughout the entire engagement, Marines had attempted to distinguish combatants from noncombatants; that the force used was proportional, and that the Marines provided adequate medical care to non-coalition force casualties. His investigation concluded that the insurgents had violated the LOAC essentially by using homes occupied by noncombatants to attack the Marines. Colonel Watt, however, did conclude that Marines had failed to comply with the ROE in that they had failed to positively identify (PID) targets as legitimate before engaging, resulting in the death of noncombatants. As a result, Colonel Watt recommended further investigation by the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) or NCIS. Again: The Watt investigation had found that noncombatants had not been deliberately targeted, engaged or killed.

  There was also a seperate review tasked, which overlapped with some NCIS matters—to which results were shared, this is known as the Bargewell report—which examined incident reporting and LOAC training/climate. It finds "the preponderance of the evidence shows that the overall deficiencies in reporting and follow-on action—while sometimes perplexing—were not the result of an extensive and orchestrated criminal cover-up throughout the chain of command."<sup>[[1]](https://www.mcmilitarylaw.com/documents/000_mg_bargewell_15-6__haditha_report_.bates.pdf)</sup></sup> Turning back to the NCIS: NCIS did uncover what they believed to be deliberate killings. NCIS charged Marines, this triggered more formal investigative proceedings, known as an Article 32. Here, several cases were dropped and one officer was acquitted at court-martial. Only one took a plea agreement. Where he pleaded guilty to one count of negligent dereliction of duty. The investigating officer wrote here, "I believe after reviewing all the evidence that no trier of fact can conclude Staff Sgt. Wuterich formed the criminal intent to kill. The case against Staff Sgt. Wuterich is simply not strong enough to conclude he committed murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Almost all witnesses have an obvious bias or prejudice." Why were cases dropped? Because the Article 32 investigating officer examined all forensic evidence, cross-examined witnesses, and found the NCIS theory of events to be unsupported by all evidence. Justice was served.<sup>[[2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/specials/iraq/documents/SharrattReport070607.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/lcpl_sharratt_report)</sup></sup>

  Finally in 2024, a journalist, attempting to make a name for herself, lied to the Government and used the dishonest family as pawns to obtain photos from the scene.

- On August 28, 2005, Reuters journalists in an unmarked vehicle, were filming an ongoing insurgent ambush of the Iraqi Police Services (IPS) and U.S. forces personnel in Bagdad. Around the time of the resurgence, a soldier on the Mall roof observed a lone white vehicle stopped on the roadway at the point where a roadway ramp closest to the Mall merged into an adjacent, parallel road; the roadway where the ambush was ongoing. When observed, the vehicle faced north and was south of the 256th BCT vehicles responding to the ambush. The soldier said he saw the passenger hanging out the window pointing something that appeared to be an RPG; the soldier then yelled an alarm, “RPG.” The soldiers’ team leader heard the alarm and observed the vehicle stopped immediately west of them and facing north toward the 256th BCT vehicles and the ambush area. He also saw the passenger hanging out the passenger window pointing something toward the tanks. He could not positively identify the object and asked another team member to bring binoculars. The team leader testified that by the time he got the binoculars, the passenger had pulled himself and the object he pointed back inside the vehicle; the object was no longer visible. The team leader said he shouted at the people in the vehicle to get them to stop whatever they were doing and he and his team fired warning shots to get their attention. He told us he fired the first shots expecting the vehicle to stay where it was, but it began to back up. They fired more warning shots and when the vehicle did not halt, the team leader ordered disabling shots. Each of the four soldiers on the roof fired disabling shots. Three of the soldiers used M-4 rifles. The fourth solider used an M-249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW). The vehicle slowed and rolled to a stop against a roadway lane barrier south of the soldiers’ position. The team leader reported disabling the vehicle, and one of the tank commanders, using the tank’s optical system, observed the disabled vehicle’s driver apparently dead. The tank commander told the team leader to continue surveillance of the vehicle and keep it in place until the tanks and other 256th BCT vehicles finished searching for the people who initiated the ambush. The soldiers remained on the observation post (OP) until the IO arrived at the scene. About 20 minutes later, the tanks and other 256 the BCT vehicles arrived at the disabled white vehicle. According to the cameraman, who had remained out of sight in the front passenger seat, he sat up and called out “Reuters Cameraman” to the approaching soldiers. This engagement abided by ROE. Reuters Baghdad bureau’s safety practices contributed to the incident. The bureau chief authorized an exception to general safety procedures, allowing local national journalists to enter hostile environments in private passenger vehicles without press markings and without the occupants wearing safety equipment.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20090401200028/http://www.dodig.osd.mil/Inspections/IPO/reports/Reuters%20Final%20Print%20Version.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- In November, 2004, in Fallujah, Iraq, TF 2-2 provided indirect fire support to US forces during the battle for Fallujah. During the battle, TF 2-2 lawfully deployed White Phosphorus munitions, described as "shake and bake", to flush out insurgents out of trench lines and spider holes, because of its Psychological impact. To quote from the March 2005 magazine Field Artillery, 'The Fight for Fallujah', "WP proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breeches and, later in the fight, as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes when we could not get effects on them with HE. We fired “shake and bake” missions at the insurgents, using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20200813022427/https://sill-www.army.mil/fires-bulletin-archive/archives/2005/MAR_APR_2005/MAR_APR_2005_FULL_EDITION.pdf)</sup></sup> This entry was misquoted by media to allege that US forces were deploying WP munitions against combatants for its incendiary and/or chemical effects.

- In May 2004, US conducted a raid near the Iraq-Syrian border, targeting several HVTs of the Zarqawi network. The NYT and AP alleged this was a wedding near Mukaradeeb, where many civilians were killed as a result of the raid. However, Signals, Human and Satellite intelligence as well as forensic and contradictory and inconsistent local testimony during interviews proved this allegation false.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/may-18-04-raid)</sup></sup>

- On April 2004, Iraq, CPL Pat Tillman was killed in a friendly fire incident. Pundits claim that he was deliberately killed by his fellow unit members because he had anti-war leanings, and allege there was a coverup. This erroneous conclusion is based on a misreading of several basic facts. 
  
  Background: 
  On April 22, 2004, the 2nd Platoon, A Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment was conducting operations in the vicinity of Magarah, Afghanistan. Because of difficulties caused by an inoperable tactical vehicle, and the mission to achieve an established objective by nightfall, the platoon ground assault convoy of 12 vehicles, was split into 2 groups or "serials." Tillman was in Serial 1. After the split, Serial 1 traveled down the canyon road without incident arriving in the vicinity of the village of Manah. Serial 2, however, did not proceed along the separate planned route because SFC believed the risk of accidental injury or death to be too great given the terrain. Therefore, SFC  ordered Serial 2 to travel down the same canyon road that Serial 1 had taken earlier. While traveling down the canyon road, Serial 2 came under attack from enemy mortar or rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire originating from the top of the canyon walls. Upon hearing them, Serial 1 personnel dismounted their vehicles and moved on foot through a small village to an elevated spur overlooking the canyon road below and across from the southern ridgeline. CPL Tillman, Private First Class (PFC) and an AMF soldier positioned themselves on the forward slope of the spur visible from and exposed to the canyon road below. 1LT and Specialist (SPC) (the Radio Operator), having been delayed by handling communications devices, were positioned at the base of a building in the village some distance below and to the rear of SSG and other Serial 1 personnel.
 
  The first U.S. vehicle in Serial 2 was led by SSG (the squad leader), with a driver and five other occupants. As SSG and his crew moved down the canyon road, they fired their weapons in suppressive fire along the canyon walls. When SSG's vehicle exited the narrow portion of the canyon road below the spur where CPL Tillman and his team were located, occupants saw muzzle flashes coming from that position. SSG and his team directed their fire toward the muzzle flashes killing both CPL Tillman and the AMF soldier. As SSG's vehicle proceeded past the spur toward the village, vehicle occupants continued to fire on the building in the settlement hitting 1LT in the face and SPC in the knee and chest with small arms fire.

  There were several investigations taken into the incident. The first 3 had some significant quality issues, however, as the IG review finds, "Notwithstanding our conclusions with respect to these three investigations, we emphasize that all investigators established the basic facts of CPL Tillman's death -- that it was caused by friendly fire, that occupants of one vehicle in CPL Tillman's platoon were responsible, and that circumstances on the ground at the time caused those occupants to misidentify friendly forces as hostile. None of the investigations suggested that CPL Tillman's death was other than accidental. Our review, as well as the investigation recently completed by the Army CID, obtained no evidence contrary to those key findings. Because CPL Tillman's regimental commander desired to keep information concerning the death "close hold" until investigative results were finalized, no "supplemental reports" were issued to correct initial reports that CPL Tillman's death was caused by enemy fire. Although LTG Kensinger knew friendly fire was suspected and under investigation before he served as the Army representative at CPL Tillman's memorial service on May 3, 2004, he decided to withhold notification from family members until all facts concerning the incident could be verified."

  BG Jones testified that he determined Pat's friend destroyed his personal items because: (1) CPL Tillman's death had already been established as fratricide by Service members who performed the destruction and who, therefore, saw no need to retain evidence and (2) the retained items were permeated with blood and posed a biological hazard." This, however, did go against DoD regulations on evidence preservation—consequently, those Rangers were kicked out of the Military, among other punishments. Lastly, two independent forensic reviews concluded under CID, that the two deaths were accidental, and that tight groupings of the bullets are very much possible and common, especially when mounted.<sup>[[1]](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Aug/16/2001955054/-1/-1/1/TILLMAN_REDACTED_WEB_0307-1.PDF)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.c-span.org/video/?197332-1/findings-corporal-tillman-death)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/LLI/Ethics/Leadership%20Ethics%20LOW%20Discussion%20Guide%20Minus%20Hadith%202008.pdf?ver=2018-09-25-100015-853#page=126)</sup></sup>

- On April 8, 2003, an American tank shell hit the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad, killing journalists Taras Protsyuk and José Couso. An independent investigation found this was not a war crime. By April 7, Coalition forces were encircling Baghdad and facing intense resistance, with enemy combatants operating from civilian areas. A Company of the 4-64 Armor faced heavy fire while trying to secure a critical intersection, prompting them to call for air support. During the fighting, they identified an enemy observer believed to be directing fire from the hotel. A single tank round was fired at the suspected position, which led to a cessation of enemy fire. It was later discovered that journalists had been injured or killed in the incident, but intelligence indicated that the hotel was being used by the enemy for military operations. A Company acted in self-defense and in accordance with the Rules of Engagement, operating in a high-intensity combat zone where some journalists chose to stay despite warnings.<sup>[[1]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2003/08/mil-030812-centcom02.htm)</sup></sup>

- On 30 June, 2002, Kakarak in Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan. As Operation Full Throttle (OFT) commenced, AAA weapons were fired and, as a result, an AC-130 aircraft, acting properly and in accordance with the rules, engaged the locations of those weapons. Further, no, there was no b-52 bomber present. Great care was taken to strike only those sites that were actively firing that night. Locals claimed after the engagement that Coalition forces fired at a wedding party, that the people were only celebrating the event by firing weapons into the air. They also claimed hundreds were killed as a result, and that US forced delayed treatment. However, an independent Board investigation revealed: that the numbers of civilians injured/killed were greatly exaggerated; that there was no wedding party and no delay occurred. In all, at least 38 killed, and 104 injured. Many civilians were treated, saving life and limb.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/oft_20240226)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20021207215250/http://www.centcom.mil/News/Reports/Investigation_Oruzgan_Province.htm)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists claim that after the US invaded Iraq in 2003, it stole money and gold from Saddam for unstated reasons. However, in reality these assets were used for reconstruction efforts, under what would eventually become known as the Commander’s Emergency Response Program (CERP). "In  March  2003,  in  the  initial  phases  of  U.S.  combat  operations  in  Baghdad,  a  large  quantity of  cash—more than $900 million in all—was discovered hidden behind  a villa belonging to one of Saddam Hussein’s key associates. In April,  President  George  W.  Bush  issued  a  memorandum  giving  DoD  the   authority to spend such cash to assist Iraqis and support reconstruction efforts. CERP, the name that would be given to this authority in June 2003, was born."<sup>[[1]](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1508.html)</sup></sup>

- In 2003, the US-led Coalition legally invaded Iraq pursuant to UNSC Resolution 1441.<sup>[[1]](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1096&context=ils)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1097&context=ils)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/preemption-iraq-and-international-law/673D4DFDBFA2DA8C5492B8E93AC3A66F)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/international-law-and-the-war-in-iraq/9497441CD9732611CF7226DC3B4ADF6B)</sup></sup> This was preceded by years of Iraqi non-compliance with prior resolutions plus a ceasefire agreement. The popular myth is that the US and UK Governments lied to justify invasion, for ulterior motives, such as oil. However, several Congressional an Parliamentary investigations found  such accusations as totally baseless. First, the UK's July 2003 Intelligence and Security Committee Hutton report, found, "We conclude that on the basis of the evidence available to us, Alastair Campbell did not exert or seek to exert improper influence on the drafting of the September dossier... We conclude that the claims made in the September dossier were in all probability well founded on the basis of the intelligence then available. We further conclude that, in the absence of reliable evidence that intelligence personnel have either complained about or sought to distance themselves from the content of the dossier, allegations of politically inspired meddling cannot credibly be established." The committee also found allegations surrounding the 3 February 2003 "February Iraq Dossier" to also be false: "Consistent with the conclusions reached elsewhere in this Report, we conclude that Ministers did not mislead Parliament." The Government and the Committee agreed in terms of how the dossier was handled, "As we said earlier, the February document contained a significant amount of intelligence-derived material provided by the SIS. However, its publication without consulting the SIS or the JIC Chairman was a mistake – as was the inclusion of material without attribution."<sup>[[5]](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmfaff/813/813.pdf)</sup></sup> This investigation was supported by a seperate September 2003 ISC Taylor report, "We are content that the JIC has not been subjected to political pressures, and that its independence and impartiality has not been compromised in any way. The dossier was not “sexed up” by Alastair Campbell or anyone else." The Taylor report ends by fully agreeing with the findings of the Hutton report, stating, "we agree" to its conclusion that "Ministers did not mislead Parliament."<sup>[[6]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7c5819ed915d338141e317/5972.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Lastly, a July 2004 Committee made several findings, "We have examined the intelligence to support these statements and consider the JIC’s judgements to be well-founded and properly expressed."<sup>[[7]](https://irp.fas.org/world/uk/butler071404.pdf#page=76)</sup></sup> It continues, "We conclude that, on the basis of the intelligence assessments at the time, covering both Niger and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the statements on Iraqi attempts to buy uranium from Africa in the Government’s dossier, and by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, were well-founded. By extension, we conclude also that the statement in President Bush’s State of the Union Address of 28 January 2003 that: 'The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.' was well-founded. We also note that, because the intelligence evidence was inconclusive, neither the Government’s dossier nor the Prime Minister went on to say that a deal between the Governments of Iraq and Niger for the supply of uranium had been signed, or uranium shipped."<sup>[[8]](https://irp.fas.org/world/uk/butler071404.pdf#page=137)</sup></sup> The 2004 report states, "we have concluded that: It is accepted by all parties that Iraqi officials visited Niger in 1999; The British Government had intelligence from several different sources indicating that this visit was for the purpose of acquiring uranium. Since uranium constitutes almost three-quarters of Niger’s exports, the intelligence was credible; The evidence was not conclusive that Iraq actually purchased, as opposed to having sought, uranium and the British Government did not claim this; The forged documents were not available to the British Government at the time its assessment was made, and so the fact of the forgery does not undermine it."<sup>[[9]](https://irp.fas.org/world/uk/butler071404.pdf#page=139)</sup></sup> Like the previous reports, it finds no evidence of surrounding allegations of the September dossier.<sup>[[10]](https://irp.fas.org/world/uk/butler071404.pdf#page=90)</sup></sup> It goes on to state, "We have considered carefully whether the dossier was explicitly intended to make a case for war. We have seen no evidence that this was the Government’s purpose. The dossier was a broadly-based document which could support a range of policy options. We conclude that the dossier was not intended to make the case for a particular course of action in relation to Iraq. It was intended by the Government to promote domestic and international understanding of, and gain support for, the general direction in which Government policy had been moving since the early months of 2002, away from containment to a more proactive approach to enforcing Iraqi disarmament."<sup>[[11]](https://irp.fas.org/world/uk/butler071404.pdf#page=91)</sup></sup> <sup>[[12]](https://irp.fas.org/world/uk/butler071404.pdf#page=92)</sup></sup> 

  Finally, the 2004 report finds the following: "In general, we found that the original intelligence material was correctly reported in JIC assessments. We should record in particular that we have found no evidence of deliberate distortion or of culpable negligence. We found no evidence of JIC assessments and the judgements inside them being pulled in any particular direction to meet the policy concerns of senior officials on the JIC. We were impressed by the quality of intelligence assessments on Iraq’s nuclear capabilities. They were in our view thorough, balanced and measured."<sup>[[13]](https://irp.fas.org/world/uk/butler071404.pdf#page=125)</sup></sup> It continues, "Even now it would be premature to reach conclusions about Iraq’s prohibited weapons. Much potential evidence may have been destroyed in the looting and disorder that followed the cessation of hostilities. Other material may be hidden in the sand, including stocks of agent or weapons. We believe that it would be a rash person who asserted at this stage that evidence of Iraqi possession of stocks of biological or chemical agents, or even of banned missiles, does not exist or will never be found. But as a result of our Review, and taking into account the evidence which has been found by the ISG and de-briefing of Iraqi personnel, we have reached the conclusion that prior to the war the Iraqi regime: a) Had the strategic intention of resuming the pursuit of prohibited weapons programmes, including if possible its nuclear weapons programme, when United Nations inspection regimes were relaxed and sanctions were eroded or lifted. b) In support of that goal, was carrying out illicit research and development, and procurement, activities, to seek to sustain its indigenous capabilities. c) Was developing ballistic missiles with a range longer than permitted under relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions."<sup>[[14]](https://irp.fas.org/world/uk/butler071404.pdf#page=130)</sup></sup> And of course, the death-blow to conspiracy theorists regarding ulterior motives: "We saw no evidence that a motive of the British Government for initiating military action was securing continuing access to oil supplies."<sup>[[15]](https://irp.fas.org/world/uk/butler071404.pdf#page=153)</sup></sup>

  For the US side: A Senate Intelligence Committee study found that all public statements by US officials were indeed supported by the intelligence at the time.<sup>[[16]](https://archive.org/details/110345)</sup></sup> Another study by the same committee found that no intelligence was fabricated, or skewed or that analysts were pressured to making an assessment—concluding, "The Committee was not presented with  any evidence that intelligence analysts changed their judgments  as a result of political pressure, altered or produced intelligence products to conform  with Administration policy, or that  anyone even attempted to coerce, influence  or pressure analysts to do so. When asked whether analysts were pressured in any way to alter their assessments  or make their judgments  conform  with Administration policies, not a single analyst answered yes."<sup>[[17]](https://web.mit.edu/simsong/www/iraqreport2-textunder.pdf#page=368)</sup></sup>

  It has been alleged in false press reports and political pundits that Rumsfeld, the Deputy Secretary, Doug Feith and others in the Defense Department, through the Counterterrorism Evaluation Group (PCTEG) and Office of Special Plans (OSP), distorted intelligence in order to argue that Iraq had a direct role in the 9/11 attacks, or that Iraq and al-Qaida had a stronger relationship than shown by facts known at the time, in order to propel the United States to war on false pretenses. This conspiracy theory was debunked by a 2007 DoD OIG report, management comments and a Congressional review. A seperate Congressional report found, "The analysts interviewed indicated that most of the OSD staffers' concerns had to do with the use of too many caveats to the reporting, and the "tone" of the document. Each analyst, as well as the meeting's chairman, indicated the OUSDP staffer 'played by IC rules' in terms of their participation. In other words, each point that was raised was discussed, debated, and incorporated only if there was agreement around the table."<sup>[[18]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/ousd011707.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[19]](https://archive.org/details/pctegreview)</sup></sup> <sup>[[20]](https://web.mit.edu/simsong/www/iraqreport2-textunder.pdf#page=372)</sup></sup> <sup>[[21]](https://archive.org/details/osp-overview)</sup></sup>
  
  It's worthy to note the ISG uncovered information that the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) maintained throughout 1991 to 2003 a set of undeclared covert laboratories to research and test various chemicals and poisons, primarily for intelligence operations. The existence, function, and purpose of the laboratories were never declared to the UN. The IIS program included the use of human subjects for testing purposes. Chemical weapons continued to be located and destroyed from 2004 to 2011.<sup>[[22]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1307507-nytfoiarequest.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[23]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1307370/duelfer-report-volume-iii.pdf)</sup></sup> CIA's own retrospective series also concludes that Iraq's own actions, even when seemingly trying to become transparent, made them look suspicious. And of course, their often less than forthcoming on other areas raised concerns with many foreign intelligence services, not just the US and UN.<sup>[[24]](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=721802)</sup></sup>

## Interrogations/detentions 2002-2008
Due to considerable public confusion (thanks in large part to media/NGO pundits) on GWOT's detention activities, it's prudent to concisely clarify that there are 3 areas distinct from one another: 
   1) Abu Ghraib and Bagram: Had rare cases of unauthorised detainee abuse, only some of these led to death and GBH, all responsible were investigated, charged and convicted. This is where the famous photos come from. Over 60,000 total detainees were treated humanely and with respect.
   2) GTMO: had seen approved of techniques that closely followed FM 34-52, such as faked identity of interrogator, deception such as forged documents, and yelling, (though not in the ear). No enhanced techniques from CIA. 
   3) CIA blacksites: In Afghanistan, had several approved enhanced techniques that had undergone legal scrutiny from DOJ, WH and CIA. These techniques were designed to fall below the threshold of torture under US and International law.<sup>[[1]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-yoofinal.pdf#page=41)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-bybeefinal.pdf#page=52)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-margolis.pdf)</sup></sup>
    
  Neither GTMO or the CIA facilities saw cases of the abuses that were, themselves, rare at Abu and Bagram. The following entries below cover these 3 areas. It must also be noted, that while the Bush Administration found that AQ and the Taliban were not subject to the Geneva Convention as unlawful combatants, it was US Policy and its obligation under IHL to still treat detainees in accordance with the Conventions.<sup>[[4]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201103234604/http://www.dia.mil/FOIA/FOIA-Electronic-Reading-Room/FOIA-Reading-Room-Detainee-Abuse/FileId/39858/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://ia601409.us.archive.org/26/items/sanchez-ig-report-pt-2/Sanchez_IG_Report_pt2.pdf#page=28)</sup></sup>
  
#### CIA Interrogations/detention (blacksites):
- Under the September 17, 2001 Memorandum of Notification, the CIA engaged in a covert program to capture, detain, and later interrogate senior AQ members. This program exampled effective oversight improvements over time, indeed, Congressional staffers notes that one CIA Black Site, "upon departing... compared the facility to both the US Military detention facility at Bagram and the facility at Guantanamo Bay. Both remarked that the facility "was markedly cleaner, healthier, more humane and better administered facility."<sup>[[6]](https://ia802305.us.archive.org/18/items/cia-congress-interactions-regarding-cia-rdi-program/cia-congress-interactions-regarding-cia-rdi-program.pdf#page=14)</sup></sup> As found by an independent audit of CIA facilities notes, "Detainees at facilities operated by CTC/RDG are provided essentials of shelter, clothing, nourishment, and hygiene; medical and psychological examinations and treatment; limited [but high quality] dental and vision care; opportunities for physical exercise and intellectual, religious, and recreational pursuits; and daily contact with facility staff.<sup>[[7]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20887990-00000000-cia-hvd-program)</sup></sup> Detainees are held in solitary confinement in climate-controlled, lighted, aboveground, windowless cells that are equipped with a mattress, a sink, and a toilet. None of the detainees showed any apparent physical signs of mistreatment."<sup>[[8]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/0006541721.pdf)</sup></sup>

  The EITs used by the Agency were highly effective, thwarting a number of planned AQ attacks, contrary to the discredited SSCI majority report's allegation<sup>[[9]](https://archive.org/details/ssci-minoritystudy)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://archive.org/details/review-of-senate-report)</sup></sup> 
  
  Renditions are perfectly legal under international law.<sup>[[11]](https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&context=luclj)</sup></sup>
  
  On January 2, 2008, Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed an Assistant United States Attorney to review prior CIA's interrogation of 101 detainees and their treatment. In his preliminary review which concluded in 2011, he found 99 cases above board with 0 abuse, mistreatment or torture under US and International law. In two cases, he found evidence warranted a full criminal investigation—that investigation closed in 2012, and found no evidence of violation of law.<sup>[[12]](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-regarding-investigation-interrogation-certain-detainees)</sup></sup> <sup>[[13]](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-eric-holder-closure-investigation-interrogation-certain-detainees)</sup></sup>

  Even within CTC, any detainee reporting to be mistreated and use of unauthorised techniques were thoroughly, independently investigated. Indeed, CTC/Legal forwarded Mr. Hawsawi's complaints to the OIG. They, in turn, forwarded it to the DOJ, as the allegations as alleged, if true—would be in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. 2340A Torture.<sup>[[14]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120073426/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/0006541723.pdf)</sup></sup> All investigations found no evidence to support the allegations, however, still updated the DOJ on the matter in 2006. This, among others, shows the Agency is not afraid to self-report allegations even by detainees for investigation. It has also been falsely claimed that the CIA did "forced feeding" via the anal route as a humiliating, unauthorised technique. However, an independent review found, "Medical personnel who administered rectal rehydration did not do so as an interrogation technique or as a means to degrade a detainee but, instead, utilized the well-acknowledged medical technique to address pressing health issues." It also highlights two main points: The technique was deemed safer than using IV needles with noncompliant detainees and was considered more efficient than a naso-gastric tube; With respect to Majid Khan, in contrast to the Study's account, our records indicate Khan removed his naso-gastric tube, which posed the risk of injury and other complications. Given this dangerous behavior, rectal rehydration was considered the most appropriate means of addressing the potential harm Khan might inflict  on himself."<sup>[[15]](https://archive.org/details/review-of-senate-report)</sup></sup>
  
- On November 2002, Gul Rahman died in CIA detention. An independent investigation found that he was not subject to torture or mistreated—that his own actions lead to his death. It reached the following conclusions: There is no evidence to suggest that Rahman's death was deliberate; There is no evidence to suggest Rahman was beaten, tortured, poisoned, strangled, or smothered; Gul Rahman's actions contributed to his own death. By throwing his last meal he was unable to provide his body with a source of fuel to keep warm. Additionally, his violent behavior resulted in his restraint which prevented him from generating body heat by moving around and brought him in direct contact with the concrete floor leading to the loss of body heat through conduction.<sup>[[16]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/0006555318.pdf)</sup></sup>
   
   This was also subject to an OIG investigation, and forwarded to DOJ for prosecutorial determination. DOJ notified it would not charge, but would include it in an ongoing special counsel review by the Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. An independent study of the RDI program found that in addition to OIG investigations and criminal prosecutions—including the extensive multi-year investigation of RDI activity by a DOJ special prosecutor, which reviewed more than 100 detainee cases—CIA convened six accountability proceedings, either at the directorate or higher level, from 2003 to 2012. These reviewed assessed the performance of 30 individuals (staff officers and contractors), and 16 were deemed accountable and sanctioned. OIG conducted two seperate major reviews and at least 29 seperate investigations of alleged misconduct. Some of these reviews were self-initiated by Agency components responsible for managing the program. CIA made numerous referrals to the OIG relating to the conduct of Agency officers and their treatment of detainees, during the life of the program as well as after. When actions appeared to violate criminal prohibitions, referrals were made to the DOJ. In total, OIG conducted nearly 60 investigations on RDI-related matters. In over 50, OIG found the allegations to be unsubstantiated or otherwise did not make findings calling for accountability review. Of the remaining cases, one resulted in a felony conviction, one resulted in termination of a contractor, and revocation of his security clearances, and six led to accountability reviews.<sup>[[17]](https://archive.org/details/review-of-senate-report)</sup></sup>
  
- In 2003, the US detained Ali Abdul Aziz Ali (Ammar al-Baluchi), an AQ operative, whose interrogation sessions provided key details on senior AQ members, disrupting plots, etc.<sup>[[18]](https://archive.org/details/ssci-minoritystudy)</sup></sup> When Ammar was transfered to GTMO, he alleged a number of various abuses against him, however, an independent IG investigation that resulted from those allegations, concluded: That he was not hit in the head with a bar or pipe; That he was not given a vaccination that made him crazy; That he was not hit on hise nose, causing it to bleed; That he was not kept in a freezing cell; That he was not threatened sexually. The review also notes that all blacksites providing a high quality care: Providing Halal meals, personal video games, books, movies, and religious items, etc. Each cell contained an in-room personal shower, gym, Koran and was climate-controlled (heater/aircon). The facilities were sterile, clean—efficient, modern–invoking a surreal feeling. During routine, monthly doctor checkups, Baluchi had two teeth fillings. In 2004, due to his fasting, fainted in his cell, causing a head injury—about half an inch long to the back side of the head.<sup>[[19]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21416908/exhibit-c-baluchi.pdf)</sup></sup> Claims he suffered psychological damage has been refuted by outside experts—who observed numerous methodological flaws and reasoning.<sup>[[20]](https://ia600800.us.archive.org/6/items/ksm-ii-ae-960-a-gov/KSM%20II%20%28AE960A%28GOV%29%29.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- Around January 2004, the CIA detained Khalid' Abd al-Razzaq al-Masri, a German citizen. This, however was an error. Not a case of mistaken identity, but a lack of intelligence to justify holding him. It was believed he was a known HVI, who goes by the alias, Khalid al-Masri. However, by mid March it was determined he should be released. The German Government was notified and he was sent back clandestinely, in May 2004. Post-release, he levied a number of accusations against the CIA. That he was sodomized, beaten, injected with drugs, and forced fed. These claims were investigated, among other things such as how he was wrongfully detained by an independent Inspector General review, which finds: "OIG's investigation found no credible information that al-Masri was subjected to physical abuse of any kind while in CIA custody. Evidence gathered during the investigation suggests that the experience that gave rise to al-Masri's allegation he was sodomized was, in fact, a routine rectal examination conducted by a physician's assistance during his initial medical examination. He ended his hunger strike when faced with the possibility of being force-fed. In keeping with standard practice for flight safety, al-Masri was restrained with flex cuffs, his eyes were covered, and he had noise suppression muffs over his ears. In consideration of CTC/RDG's request, however, al-Masri was not forced to wear a diaper (a sanitary measure for flight risks), and he was permitted to use the toilet and drink water. Al-Masri also did not wear the usual sweat clothes but wore civilian clothing specifically for him by CTC/RDG officers.<sup>[[21]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/0006541725.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Some conspiracy theorists try to suggest that the ECHR ruling on the matter is evidence of torture against al-Masri, however, it could be noted: The EU Court was a civil case—which uses lower standards of evidence. ECHR had no access to medical records from the period. The medical records (photos, scans, etc) that the IG report had access to, as well as physically seeing the detain themselves at the time, confirmed there was no abuse. The civil case relied only on testimony by Dr. Porterfield, who had only several phone calls with Khalid, and concluding that he had PTSD. However, Porterfield recommended seeing for a formal evaluation, in person. al-masri, of course declined. He didn't wan't to be caught in a lie. As for abuse/torture, 0 evidence was proffered nor examined by ECHR.

- On May 12, 2004, CIA Deputy Director McLaughlin, in closed testimony corrected the record to Congress that CIA was not involved in any of the photos seen that leaked to the media, of unauthorised detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib. He said, "We are not authorised in the program to do anything like what you have seen in those photographs."<sup>[[22]](https://archive.org/details/may-12-2004-ddcia-testimony)</sup></sup> As noted by the Office of Medical Services (OMS) on the RDI program during their review, "The empirical record affirmed effectiveness and, through the presence of OMS, the safety of the program. Finally, critically and urgency  each received case-by-case analysis from CTC. Though imperfect this review nonetheless limited the application of EITs to less than a third of the detainees who came into Agency hands, and further limited the use of the most aggressive techniques to only 5 or 6 of the highest value detainees. A criterion  of"'necessity" also requires that no aggressive measure be used when a lesser measure would suffice."<sup>[[23]](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5301943/CIA-OMS-Summary.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Contrary to conspiracy theorists, it's a myth that Maher Arar was subject to CIA's rendition program to Syria. He was sent to Syria, as he was denied entry. Nothing more. En route from Zurich, Arar was identified in the Department of State's (DOS) "TIPOFF" system as a "special interest" alien who was suspected of affiliations to terrorist activity and was described as "armed and dangerous." The TIPOFF database, at the time of Arar's arrival in the United States, was the principal database containing names of known and suspected terrorists. If an INS inspector queried the TIPOFF system with passenger information from the Advance Passenger Information System and a match occurred, the INS inspector would receive a message that the alien was the subject of a lookout. A lookout is an entry in one of several immigration and security databases that lists previously deported aliens, criminal aliens, or other aliens who were of interest to law enforcement agencies. If an alien is the subject of a lookout, this is an indication that an alien might be inadmissible to the United States and requires additional review at a U.S. port of entry (POE). Before Arar arrived at JFK, a team from the New York Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) was dispatched to interview Arar upon his arrival at JFK.

  Arar was determined by INS to be inadmissible to the United States on the grounds that he was a member of a foreign terrorist organization. On Tuesday, October 8, 2002, Arar was transported by an INS "Special Response Team" to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, where he was flown by private aircraft to Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC. At Dulles, an INS "special removal unit" boarded the plane, then accompanied Arar to Amman, Jordan, where he arrived on Wednesday, October 9,2002. Arar was later transferred to the custody of Syrian officials. DHS's IG investigated the matter twice, as did DOJ's OPR. Courts also examined. All refuted allegations made by Arar that the Government sent him to be tortured for information, and that the CIA was involved. An independent panel, studying US transfers, concluded, "In the cases of U.S. transfers under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, the United States transfer policies to date have, to the Task Force's knowledge, met or exceeded the relevant U.S. treaty obligations."<sup>[[24]](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/PDFs/The%20Removal%20of%20a%20Canadian%20Citizen%20to%20Syria%20%28Redacted%29.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[25]](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Mgmt/OIGa_08-18_Mar10.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[26]](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/2009_report_special_task_force_interrogation_and_transfer_policies/download)</sup></sup> 
  
- It has been alleged by several media outlets and NGOs that the CIA had several of the named individuals below in CIA custody, however, A review of FBI, CIA and DoD documents confirms none of these individuals were in CIA custody: Khalid Al-Zawahiri; Osama Bin Yousaf; Qari Saifullah Akhtar; Walid bin Azmi; Iban Al Yaquti al Sheikh al-Sufiyan; Amir Hussein Abdullah al-Misri; Safwan al-Hasham; Jawad al Bashar and Saif Al-Islam Al-Masri.<sup>[[27]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20392756-savage-nyt-foia-redacted-durham-report-to-holder-on-cia-detainees-not-in-cia-custody)</sup></sup>

- Political pundits allege that the CIA deliberately destroyed 92 interrogation tapes to hide from accountability, for supposedly showing torture. This makes no sense logically with timelines of various events. It has also been alleged that Gina Haspel played a role in their destruction, and ran a blacksite. Both are not true.  On 30 Nov, 2002, an independent attorney viewed the video tapes, they examined logbooks, notebooks and other materials, and all other relevant material and confirmed that the cable traffic accurately described the, interrogation methods employed and that the methods conformed to the applicable legal and policy guidance. Destruction for the tapes, out of concern the footage or stills from the video, would be leaked online, with the faces of CIA personnel, putting them in danger, was approved on 8 Nov, 2005. By this time, however, the CIA's IG had already reviewed the footage, in 2003, and all cables, notes and other material. The IG found only 12 tapes contained footage of EIT use. 82 uses of waterboarding were identified, most lasting no more than 10 seconds. 11 tapes were blank aside from two tapes for 1-2 minutes. A review of the episode found, "no fault with the performance of Ms. Haspel. I have concluded that she acted appropriately in her role as Mr. Rodriguez's Chief of Staff... she drafted the cable on the direct orders of Mr. Rodriguez; she did not release that cable. It was not her decision to destroy the tapes; it was Mr Rodriguez's." He said his reason for the decision to destroy the tapes was due to the world's reaction of the photos concerning the rare, unauthorised detainee abuse by a few Military personnel at Abu Ghraib and that, "... never denied making the decision to destroy the tapes nor did he ever attempt to cover up his decision in any way. On the contrary, from day one Mr. Rodriguez admitted his decision and has been consistent in his explanation." However, there were some that remained, in the discovery process in the EDVA, 4th Cir of Appeals, two video tapes and one audio tape were found. For the purpose of the litigation, DOJ reviewed the tapes and provided transcripts to the Court, Ex Parte. Moussaoui was not mentioned in the tapes at all—thus irrelevant to the case—however, critically, they also independently found the cables describing the interrogations, and intelligence from them, match the tapes accurately: "At our request, CIA also provided us with intelligence cables pertaining to the interviews recorded on the two tapes. Because we reviewed these cables during our discovery review, we wanted to ensure that the cables accurately captured the substance of the interrogations. Based on our comparison of the cables to the videotapes, and keeping in mind that the cables were prepared for the purpose of disseminating intelligence, we found that the intelligence cables accurately summarized the substance of the interrogations in question."<sup>[[28]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5673422-Gina-C-Haspel-CIA-Career-Timeline.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[29]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4414871/2011-02-15-Dkt-450-32-Exhibit-31.pdf#page=2)</sup></sup> <sup>[[30]](https://ia902503.us.archive.org/28/items/AZinterrogation/Document-04-CIA-Interrogation-of-Abu-Zubaydah.pdf#page=8)</sup></sup> <sup>[[31]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4443609/Morell-Memo.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[32]](https://ia601406.us.archive.org/33/items/cia04special_review/cia_2004special_review.pdf#page=43)</sup></sup> <sup>[[33]](https://coop.vaed.uscourts.gov/moussaoui/dktsheets/docs/72587/0.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[34]](https://www.propublica.org/article/cia-cables-detail-its-new-deputy-directors-role-in-torture)</sup></sup>

- On the harshest technique, the waterboarding, it should be noted that the last use ended in March 2003, and only used on 3 detainees: KSM, Al Nashiri and Abu Zubaydah. Further, its use in reality and what mental pictures people develop when they hear of waterboarding are two very different things. The CIA crafted it carefully to fall well below the threshold of torture: the waterboard may be approved for use with a given detainee only during, at most, one single 30-day period, and that during that period, the waterboard technique may be used on no more than five days. In any 24-hour period, interrogators may use no more than two "sessions" of the waterboard on a subject—with a "session" defined to mean the time that the detainee is strapped to the waterboard—and that no session may last more than two hours. Moreover, during any session, the number of individual applications of water lasting 10 seconds or longer may not exceed six. As noted above the maximum length of any application of water is 40 seconds (this maximum has rarely been reached). Finally, the total cumulative time of all applications of whatever length in a 24-hour period may not exceed 12 minutes.<sup>[[35]](https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/886271/download)</sup></sup>

The OLC opinions on EITs ended up being completely and resoundingly correct—both with international and domestic law. The following will quote on analysis of specific intent, severe pain,  US Judicial Interpretation, and international decisions—debunking the discredited OPR report.

  #### Military Interrogations/detention, Guantanamo Bay:

- After interrogations under FM 34-52 failed, Major General Michael Dunlavey requested a number of counter-resistant techniques not within FM 34-52.<sup>[[36]](https://web.archive.org/web/20090714112912/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=7487)</sup></sup> These were broken down into 3 categories. After extensive legal review, Cat 1 and 2 were approved. Only one Cat 3 was approved: Mild, non-injurious physical contact such as grabbing, poking in the chest with a finger, and light pushing. However, not even this was put into practice. Cat 2 approvals were rescinded before they could be used.<sup>[[37]](https://web.archive.org/web/20090724080341/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jun2004/d20040622doc3.pdf)</sup></sup> Upon further legal review by an independent panel, only techniques that closely followed FM 34-52 were approved. Waterboarding didn't make it through the panel's review early on.<sup>[[38]](https://ia802504.us.archive.org/27/items/IG-Church-detainee-report/ChurchReport_text.pdf#page=11)</sup></sup> Some will be tempted to regurgitate the old talking-point that "no detainee has never been charged." This is a bold lie. The vast majority of GTMO's entire population were sent back to countries they were citizens of, to face their Courts at home. Others were charged and convicted by the US Federal Courts and Military Commissions—several cases landing before SCOTUS. Detainees held, while not charged were able to challenge their combatant status—with the assistance of the Military, before a Combatant Status Review Tribunal. This process allowed many to return home, upon negotiation with other governments. Several detainees released re-engaged in terrorism. Many boasted about lying and convincing the CSRT for release, only to plan more terror attacks that killed many civilians. Further, as early as January 11, 2002, the Department of State instructed U.S. ambassadors to inform their host governments that the United States was “evaluating the possibility of returning certain individuals to their home country of nationality for further legal action.”<sup>[[39]](https://armedservices.house.gov/sites/republicans.armedservices.house.gov/themes/rep_armed_services/largedocs/leaving_guantanamo_web_3_27.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[40]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Guantanamo_Bay_Unclasssified_List_FINAL.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[41]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/detaineesFOIArelease15May2006.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[42]](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2010/06/02/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf#page=28)</sup></sup>

- An authoritative paper found that, "The mental health providers at GTMO provide care in accordance with both the APA and American Psychiatric Association ethical guidelines. The standards set forth by the Geneva Conventions for both medical and mental health care are exceeded by the medical personnel at GTMO."<sup>[[43]](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-01792-001)</sup></sup>

- In October 2006, Sgt Heather Cerveny alleged that while drinking, 4 Sailors admitted to detainee abuse at GTMO. This was refuted by consistent testimony of the 4 individuals, among others, and particular allegations she made of where these people claimed to have worked at the facility, etc. Some areas were not yet built, or their station no where near detainees. In sum, she knew she made a fictitious story.<sup>[[44]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/09-F-0049_BassettReport.pdf)</sup></sup>

- A 2005 meta-analysis found, "Intelligence operations at GTMO are conducted in a highly-structured, well-disciplined environment that is conducive to intelligence collection.... much of the credit for the structure and discipline at GTMO is due to specific policies and procedures that have developed at GTMO over time, or what we refer to in shorthand as the GTMO "model." And, "As noted above, the first 19 techniques in the current policy were virtually identical to the techniques found in FM 34-54. Of the remaining remaining techniques, dietary manipulation simply consisted of feeding detainees military field rations; sleep adjustment did not entail depriving detainees of sleep, but rather adjusting their sleep cycles from night to day; and false flag involved the sort of nonviolent trickery or ruse that is inherent in many FM 34-52 techniques." It adds, "recent media reports have fuelled controversy over detainee treatment at GTMO, as several detainees (or their lawyers). have made claims of violent physical abuse and torture. For example: Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal, Rhuhel Ahmed, Moazzam Begg, a former chauffer for Usama Bin Ladin, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib made widely-publicized claims of torture. Our review of medical records found no evidence to support allegations of torture or violent physical abuse of detainees. In fact, detainees were more likely to suffer injury from playing soccer or volleyball during recreational periods than they were from interactions with interrogators or guards. Almost without exception, therefore, detainees at GTMO have been treated humanely." Lastly, We think it bears emphasis that the military leadership at GTMO has been and is making vigorous efforts to investigate all allegations of detainee abuse, whether the allegations come from DoD personnel, contractors, the ICRC, or the detainees themselves. Detainees have numerous channels available to report allegations of abuse: they can report allegations to military police, interrogators, linguists, medical personnel and chaplains. They also have opportunities to bring any concerns to the attention of the ICRC, which is a regular presence at GTMO that advocates on the detainees' behalf. In our view, the extremely low rate of abuse [3 minor infractions] at GTMO is largely due to strong command oversight, effective leadership, and adequate training on detainee handling and treatment. Additionally, those aspects of the GTMO "model" already discussed above—namely, a command organization that placed detention and intelligence operations under the command of a single entity, JTF-GTMO; effective coordination between interrogators and military police; adequate detention and interrogation resources; and well-developed standard operating procedures—have clearly played a role in keeping detainee abuse to a minimum. All of the closed, substantiated abuse cases are relatively minor in nature, and none bears any resemblance to the abuses depicted in the Abu Ghraib photographs. Almost without exception, therefore, detainees at GTMO have been treated humanely."<sup>[[45]](https://archive.org/details/IG-Church-detainee-report/mode/2up)</sup></sup>
  
- On June 9, 2005, an investigation into FBI allegations of detainee abuse concluded. After reviewing a _three-year_ period covering more than _24,000 interrogations_, Furlow and Schmidt identified _three_ interrogation acts that were never approved for use by the government. The investigation revealed no evidence of torture or inhumane treatment at Guantanamo Bay. Interrogations were assessed, separately, to fall within bounds of US and International law, even those not approved, or were approved and never implemented.<sup>[[46]](https://archive.org/details/schmidt-furlow)</sup></sup>

- In early January of 2009, Under orders from President Obama The Secretary of Defense tasked a special DoD team to review the conditions of confinement at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base, to ensure all detainees there are being held “in conformity with all applicable laws governing the conditions of confinement, including Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.”  The Review Team "conducted an investigation on site that included more than 100 interviews with JTF-Guantánamo leadership, support staff, interrogators, and guards, multiple announced and unannounced inspections of all camps during daylight and night operations, reviewed numerous reports, video, discipline records, and observed many aspects of daily operations. Collectively, talked to a number of detainees and observed detainee activities, including enteral feedings and interrogations. The review Team also solicited a sampling of opinion, studies, and published works, which reflected the perspective of detainees and other concerned interest groups, many with recommendations to improve detention conditions. This included our request for additional views from four organizations who wrote to the President concerning Guantánamo on January 30, 2009: Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International. These organizations responded to that request on February 6, 2009, and their submissions were carefully considered. After considerable deliberation and a comprehensive review, it is our judgment that the conditions of confinement in Guantánamo are in conformity with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions."<sup>[[47]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2918343/Review-of-Department-Compliance-With-Presidents.pdf)</sup></sup>
 
  It is worth noting as well that even the least compliant detainees at Guantanamo Bay are provided with two to eight hours a day of recreation, quarterly meetings with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), ICRC messages, mail, skype, and phone access, Halal meals with several menu choices, prayer beads, prayer rugs, and other religious accommodations, as well as a library, 178 satellite TV stations, 79 satellite radio stations, classes, movies, and video games.<sup>[[48]](https://www.lawfareblog.com/federal-prosecution-viable-option-enemy-combatants)</sup></sup> Where hunger strike was concerned, the SOP was the following: "A JMG medical provider will counsel the detainee who is on hunger strike as to the medical hazards of a prolonged period without food and/or water. The medical staff shall explain the medical risks faced by the detainee and make a reasonable effort to convince the detainee to resume eating food and drinking water".<sup>[[49]](https://www.aele.org/law/gitmo-force-feed.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- GTMO handling of the Koran. To respect the cultural and respect to Islam, GTMO issued SOPs that mitigated the likelihood of guards ever touching the Koran. "To ensure the safety of the detainees and guards while respecting the cultural dignity of the Korans thereby reducing the friction over the searching the Korans. JTF-GTMO personnel directly working with detainees will avoid handling or touching the detainee’s Koran whenever possible. Handling. (1) Clean gloves will be put on in full view of the detainees prior to handling. (2) Two hands will be used at all times when handling the Koran in manner signaling respect and reverence. Care should be used so that the right hand is the primary one used to manipulateany part of the Koran due to the cultural association with the left hand. Handle the Koran as if it were a fragile piece of delicate art"—among many other protocols to ensure respect for Islam and associated culture.<sup>[[50]](https://web.archive.org/web/20080530003553/http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/english/2005_06/Other/pdf/PR050603-b.pdf)</sup></sup>
 
- In 2005, allegations that guards at GTMO mishandled/disrespected the Koran (Quran) were independently investigated by Jay Hood. The inquiry reviewed over three years worth of records, totalling 31,000 documents, both electronic and hard copy, including: sixty-three Habeas petitions, thirty-eight press articles, etc. While only 4 of these were confirmed, there were 15 confirmed cases of detainees mishandling the Quran. Further, contrary to allegations, the inquiry found no credible evidence that a member of the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay ever flushed a Koran down a toilet. However, a detainee did flush another detainee's in the toilet.<sup>[[51]](https://web.archive.org/web/20050611060110/http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/english/2005_06/Other/pdf/PR050603a.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[52]](https://web.archive.org/web/20080530003534/http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/english/2005_06/Other/pdf/PR050603.pdf)</sup></sup>

#### Military Interrogations/detention, Abu Ghraib/Bagram:
- Unauthorised detainee abuse were already subject to independent investigations at Abu Ghraib and Bagram. It should be noted: That this was rare, done by a "small group of morally corrupt soldiers and civilians". Accountability was swift when thoroughly investigated. As noted in a comprehensive examination of detainee handling even as early as July 2004, there was no systemic abuse, or causes of abuse. The vast majority were in compliance with DoD standards for humane treatment and care. Some may be tempted to quote the Taguba report as evidence of "systemic abuse". However, this is folly. As used in the Taguba investigation, the term "systemic" deals with a subset of the security and interrogation operations at only one interment/resettlement facility and is not theater-wide. Further, MG Taguba testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on 11 May 04, narrowing the extent of the term “systemic” by stating that these particular abuses were individual actions not committed at the direction of the chain of command and that the resulting photos were taken with personal cameras. As an IG report independently finds, "Based on our review and analysis  of reports and case summaries of Investigations and our observations and interviews conducted throughout this inspection, we could not identify a systemic cause for the abuse incidents."<sup>[[55]](https://archive.org/details/detainee-operations-inspection)</sup></sup> <sup>[[56]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nationi/documents/fay_report_8-25-04.pdf)</sup></sup>
 
  As for the leadership of Abu Ghraib, during the brief period of the rare, unauthorised detainee abuse, two independent investigations were conducted in 2005: One by the Army IG, the other by the Army's JAG Office. They examined 5 senior officers: Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, Maj. Gen. Walter Wojdakowski, Maj. Gen. Barbara G. Fast, Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, and Col. Marc Warren. To this end, the DAIG examined previously completed investigations, while conducting its own, more thorough review—it examined allegations of dereliction in the performance of duties pertaining to detention and interrogation operations, and improperly communicating interrogation policies. The DAIG found all these allegations unfounded, aside from two in the case of Karpinski. Allegation of shoplifting and dereliction were found substantiated. Though Karpinski’s performance of duty was found to be lacking in niche areas, the investigation determined that no action or lack of action on her part contributed specifically to the abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib. The probe also found the allegation she did not punish those under her command unfounded, and that she strived to do so, when allegations arose. President Bush approved the recommendation to demote Karpinski to Colonel, and honourably discharged from service. The JAG's PSI cleared Col. Marc Warren.<sup>[[57]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413065842/https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Sanchez_IG_Report_pt1.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[58]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413195544/https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Sanchez_IG_Report_pt2.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[59]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/fast_ig_report.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[60]](https://web.archive.org/web/20190309165139/https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Wojdakowski_IG_Report.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[61]](https://archive.org/details/karpinski-daig)</sup></sup> <sup>[[62]](https://web.archive.org/web/20050510232110/http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=7293)</sup></sup>

- On September 23, 2009, an independent investigation found that allegations that the DoD, between September 2001 to April 2008 was using "mind-altering drugs" on detainees to be unsubstantiated. Some detainees were medicated to treat diagnosed mental conditions. (also examines GTMO).<sup>[[63]](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Oct/31/2001836211/-1/-1/1/09-INTEL-13.PDF)</sup></sup>

- On November 8, 2009, an investigation of US Special Forces at Abu Ghraib found that a number allegations of detainee abuse were unsubstantiated and contradicted by the evidence. In general, facilities met the standards under international law as well as US law and policy. It did discover some issues, and made recommendations for mandatory corrective training.<sup>[[64]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/FormicaReportRelease.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On 4 November, 2004, members of SEAL team 7 captured Manadal al-Jamaidi (also spelled Manadel al-Jamadi), a terror cell leader, in Iraq. During capture, he resisted apprehension by kicking and assaulting ST7 personnel. In response to this non-compliance, open-handed use of force were applied. Unknown to ST7 personnel, this caused internal complications. The subject was at this time, wearing a head cover for security reasons. While at the ST7 compound, al-Jamaidi was placed in an interview room. He was coherent in answering basic questions. From here, he was sent off to AGP. While en route to the prison, Subject was coherent and made no comments about physical distress or discomfort. Once at the prison, Subject was dressed in an orange prison uniform by the Military Police assigned to the prison and escorted to a room for further questioning. (His head cover was still not removed at this point). For security, subject was subsequently restrained to the bars on the window and questioning continued. Shortly after restraining Subject to the window, [redacted] moved Subject's head cover up above his mouth and nose while keeping Subject's vision restricted. Subject was maintaining a coherent conversation and never said anything about being in discomfort or in need of medical attention. There was no evidence of bleeding or injury to the subject at this point. After approximately one hour and a half hours of questioning, [redacted] observed Subject slump toward the floor. [redacted] immediately sought the assistance of the Military Police whose post was within 15 feet of the interview room. Three Military Police Officers immediately entered the room and took control of Subject. It should be noted, there were open windows to the interview room enabling the Military Police to hear the entire custodial debriefing. While Military Police assisted Subject to his feet, [redacted] observed that Subject did not appear to be breathing and the head cover was removed from Subject's eyes immediately. Once the head cover was removed, [redacted] observed that Subject had a bruised/swollen right eye. There were no other observable bruises or contusions noted on Subject's body. Upon autopsy, The deputy medical examiner concluded that the position in which Al-Jamaidi was placed during the interrogation exacerbated his otherwise serious but non-life-threatening internal injuries and compromised his breathing.<sup>[[65]](https://archive.org/details/cia-oig-al-jamadi-report-produced-janury-2024)</sup></sup> <sup>[[66]](https://archive.org/details/al-Jamaidi)</sup></sup> <sup>[[67]](https://archive.org/details/cidal-jamaidi)</sup></sup> 

- A CIA contractor, on June 21, 2003, assaulted Abdul Wali, at a Military base. Wali soon died from injury. This was not part of the EIT program nor sanctioned or condoned by anyone. Immediately after the death—the CID and CIA conducted independent, and thorough investigations—CIA made a criminal referral to DOJ, who prosecuted David Passaro. Passaro was sentenced to 8 years and 4 months in prison and three years of supervised release. This was over double what federal sentencing guidelines usually recommend for assault charges. Passaro was also the first American charged under the U.S. Patriot Act, which extended the jurisdiction of U.S. federal courts to include certain violations of the law committed by military contractors overseas.<sup>[[68]](https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/nce/press/2004/2004-Jun-17.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[69]](https://archive.org/details/passaro-oig)</sup></sup> <sup>[[70]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201016180137/https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/press-release-archive-2006/pr08172006.htm)</sup></sup>

- On December 10, 2002, a number of US Military personnel (20) were involved in detainee abuse that resulted in the death of two men, one of whom was Dilawar. CIA had no involvement in this matter. All men were convicted.<sup>[[71]](https://archive.org/details/doddoacid-011770)</sup></sup>

- By mid-2004, 155 investigations into detainee abuse allegations had been completed, resulting in 66 substantiated cases. An independent panel concluded, "No approved procedures called for or allowed the kinds of abuses that in fact occurred. There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military authorities."<sup>[[72]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/d20040824finalreport.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Lastly, the previously mentioned September 2005 Navy Inspector General, also known as the Church report conducted a meta-study of all previous reviews, investigations of GTMO, Abu Ghraib, and elsewhere—as well as its own fresh investigation: "we examined the 187 DoD investigations of alleged detainee abuse that had been closed as of September 30, 2004. Of these investigations, 71 (or 38%) had resulted in a finding of substantiated detainee abuse, including six cases involving detainee deaths. 8 of the 71 cases occurred at GTMO, all of which were relatively minor in their physical nature. Additionally, 130 cases remained open, with investigations ongoing. Finally, our investigation indicated that commanders are making vigorous efforts to investigate every allegation of abuse—regardless of whether the allegations are made by DoD personnel, civilian contractors, detainees, the ICRC, the local populace, or any other source." One case was removed from this statistical report leaving it to just 70 substantiated. Of the 70, there were only 121 victims. Disciplinary action was taken against a total of 115 personnel. The investigation found no link between approved interrogation techniques and detainee abuse." The report also finds, "An early focus of our investigation was to determine whether DoD had promulgated interrogation policies or guidance that directed, sanctioned or encouraged the abuse of detainees. We found that this was not the case. While no universally accepted definition of "torture" or "abuse" exists, the theme that runs throughout the Geneva Conventions, international law and US military doctrine is that detainees must be treated "humanely." Moreover, the President, in his February 7, 2002 memorandum that determined that al Qaeda and the Taliban are not entitled to EPW protections under the Geneva Convention, reiterated the standard of "humane" treatment. We found, without exception, that the DoD officials and senior military commanders responsible for the formulation of interrogation policy evidenced the intent to treat detainees humanely, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion that such officials or commanders ever  accepted that detainee abuse would be permissible. Even in the absence of precise definition of "humane" treatment, it is clear that none of the pictured abuse at Abu Ghraib bear any resemblance to approved policies at any level, in any theater. We note, therefore, that our conclusion is consistent with the Independent Panel, which in its August 2004 report determined that "no approved procedures called for or allowed the kinds of abuse that in fact occurred. There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military authorities."<sup>[[73]](https://archive.org/details/IG-Church-detainee-report)</sup></sup>

- Claims that the United States invaded Afghanistan to control the poppy fields and protect the market have proven time and time again to be false, ignoring the US-led effort to destroy, disrupt and phase out poppy cultivation in the land, working with the Afghanistan Government and ISAF to reach this goal. This goal has had its ups and downs, and did work overall. While poppy production increased over the years; it stemmed from Taliban/AQ-controlled regions—not those controlled by the Government. Prior to the presense of US personnel in Afghanistan, 2001, poppy and other drugs skyrocketed under the Taliban regime.<sup>[[1]](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/inl/rls/other/102214.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/90671.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.sigar.mil/interactive-reports/counternarcotics/index.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20171213_RL30588_0a51c51635f5c5fcd227fe6dc9d4dda135ef1aa4.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://media.defense.gov/2007/Jul/01/2001712995/-1/-1/1/Counternarcotics_Pgr_Afghan%20_Final%20Rpt.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/testimonies/witnesses/attachments/2016/02/02/01-15-14_dea_capra_testimony_re_future_us_counternarcotics_efforts_in_afghanistan_web_ready.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://archive.org/details/drug-trade-flourish-under-taliban)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://archive.org/details/taliban-support-drugs)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://archive.org/details/nie-may-2001-report )</sup></sup>

- A 2003 international group of experts, by the IAEA, reviewed sites in Kuwait in which Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions were used in the First Gulf War. The report finds: "On the basis of the measurements carried out at the sites investigated in the IAEA’s study and summarized in this report, DU does not pose a radiological hazard to the population of Kuwait... Annual radiation doses that could arise from exposure to DU residues would be very low and of little radiological concern. Annual radiation doses in the areas where residues do exist would be of the order of a few microsieverts, well below the annual doses received by the population of Kuwait from the natural sources of radiation in the environment and far below the reference level recommended by the IAEA as a criterion to help establish whether remedial actions are necessary."<sup>[[1]](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1164_web.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On June 26, 1993, the United States launched a cruise missile attack against a building housing the IIS in Baghdad in retaliation for the assassination attempt on former President Bush. Former President George Bush visited Kuwait between April 14 and April 16, 1993, to commemorate the allied victory in the Persian Gulf War. In late-April 1993, the United States learned that terrorists had attempted to assassinate Bush during his visit to Kuwait. The Kuwaiti authorities arrested 17 persons suspected in the plot to kill Bush using explosives hidden in a Toyota Landcruiser. The Kuwaitis recovered the Landcruiser, which contained between 80 and 90 kilograms of plastic explosives connected to a detonator (the Bush device or Bush explosive device ). The Kuwaitis also recovered ten cube-shaped plastic explosive devices with detonators (the cube-bombs) from the Landcruiser.

  On April 29, 1993, CIA bomb technicians compared the Bush explosive device to two known Iraqi explosive devices found in different Middle-Eastern countries in 1990 and 1991 (the Middle-East devices ) . The technicians reported that the remote control firing mechanism in the Bush device was identical to those in the Middle-East devices. Additionally, the technicians reported that blasting caps from the Bush device appeared to be identical to those found in one of the Middle-East devices. The technicians later concluded that the circuit board from the Bush device also closely resembled circuit boards from the Middle-East devices. In early-May 1993, the FBI sent personnel to Kuwait to interview the suspects and examine the physical evidence. FBI Special Agents, along with representatives of the Secret Service and State Department, interviewed 16 suspects, some more than once. Two of the suspects, Wali 'Abd Al-Hadi 'Abd Al-Hasan Al-Ghazali ( Al-Ghazali ) and Ra'd 'Abd Al-Amir 'Abbud Al-Asadi (Al-Asadi ), admitted during the FBI interviews that they had participated in the plot at the direction of the IIS.

  Explosives examiner Jordan also traveled to Kuwait in May 1993 to examine the Bush device. Jordan examined the main charge, which was hidden in three panels in the Landcruiser and was capable of being detonated by remote control, a timing device, or a push-pull suicide switch. Jordan compared the Bush device to photographs of the Middle-East devices, as well as other devices, and concluded that the same person or persons manufactured the Bush device and one of the Middle-East devices, and that a connection existed between persons responsible for the Bush device and several other devices, including the other Middle-East device. Jordan reported these conclusions in a May 11, 1993 Laboratory report. Jordan then returned to Washington, D.C., and delivered samples of the explosives from the Bush device to Whitehurst. Whitehurst analyzed the explosive from the main charge and concluded that the substance was approximately 96% RDX, 3% polyvinyl-isobutyl ether binder, and 1% hydrocarbon oil. As for samples from the cube-bombs, Whitehurst concluded that the explosive was consistent with an explosive containing RDX bound with a cross-linked phenoxy or epoxy binder containing Sudan I dye. Whitehurst reported these findings in his June 7, 1993, dictation.

  Shortly thereafter, Jordan returned to the Middle-East to conduct further examinations of the Bush device and the Middle-East devices. Based on these examinations, Jordan reported significant consistencies in the selection of individual components and alterations to manufactured items in all of the devices. Jordan concluded that the similarities represented signature characteristics. He further reported that the same person or persons of close association constructed the remote control fuzing systems and electronic timing mechanisms used in all of these devices. Jordan also reported that a second person or persons of close association were responsible for adding wiring and components to the Bush device and one of the Middle-East devices, enabling those devices to be incorporated in vehicles. Jordan reported these conclusions in his June 18, 1993, Laboratory report, in which he also summarized parts of Whitehurst's June 7, 1993, dictation.

  On June 2, 1993, representatives of the FBI, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and others in the Department of Justice (DOJ) discussed the results of their investigations with representatives of the Clinton Administration. Three weeks later, the DOJ and CIA reported their conclusions. The DOJ and CIA reported that it was highly likely that the Iraqi Government originated the plot and more than likely that Bush was the target. Additionally, based on past Iraqi methods and other sources of intelligence, the CIA independently reported that there was a strong case that Saddam Hussein directed the plot against Bush.

  Whitehurst claims that Ronay may have purposely misinterpreted his results in order to suggest involvement by Iraq and support the missile strike by the United States. Contrary to Whitehurst's suggestion, the decision to launch the missile strike did not turn on reports that the Bush and Southeast Asia explosives contained PE-4A. The FBI and CIA assembled extensive evidence of Iraqi involvement, including admissions from two key suspects, forensic examinations of relevant explosive devices, and intelligence from various sources. Our investigation showed that reports that the Laboratory had found PE-4A in the Bush matter and Southeast Asia cases were not a significant part of the overall evidence against the Iraqi Government. Additionally, before the missile strike, the CIA obtained various intelligence reports indicating involvement by the Iraqi Government. The CIA learned that the IIS was planning to assassinate Bush now that he had returned to private life and that the assassination attempt would occur only with authorization from Saddam Hussein. The CIA also received information suggesting that Saddam Hussein had authorized the assassination attempt to obtain personal revenge and intimidate Kuwait and other Arab states.

  In conclusion, the evidence does not support Whitehurst's claim that Ronay purposely changed or misinterpreted Whitehurst's results, either in the Laboratory reports or during discussions of those results. Nor does the evidence support Whitehurst's suggestion that the United States launched the missile strike against the IIS building in Baghdad based on a misinterpretation of Whitehurst's results.<sup>[[1]](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/publications/fbi%20crime%20lab%20doj%20ig%20report%201997.pdf)</sup></sup>

- The First Gulf War involved the US liberating Kuwait from Iraq's illegal occupation while prioritizing the reduction of civilian casualties and infrastructure damage, including the infamous "highway of death." As the final report to Congress explains, “In the early hours of 27 February, CENTCOM received a report that a concentration of vehicles was forming in Kuwait City.” Concerns about these forces potentially reinforcing Republican Guard units led to a crucial decision. CINCCENT chose not to attack the Iraqi forces in Kuwait City, stating, “it could lead to substantial collateral damage to Kuwaiti civilian property” and complicate military operations. Instead, they allowed Iraqi forces to leave, engaging them in a less populated area. The report clarifies that the attack was consistent with military doctrine: “the law of war permits the attack of enemy combatants and enemy equipment at any time, wherever located, whether advancing, retreating, or standing still.”<sup>[[1]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=638&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=664&skin=2021)</sup></sup>
 
   It has also been alleged by conspiracy theorists that the US secretly gave the "greenlight" for Saddam to invade. This is a lie. An Earth-shattering examination of the record indicates the exact opposite: "The common assertion that Saddam perceived a 'green light' from Ambassador April Glaspie or other officials in the months prior to the invasion does not withstand serious scrutiny. In Glaspie’s July 25 meeting with Saddam, she assured her interlocutor of Washington’s desire for friendship and that the United States took no position on the merits of any of the (many) Arab-Arab border demarcation disputes. Taking a legal position on the proper border, Glaspie cabled Washington, would have “change[d] radically our policy.” Yet she also warned Saddam against trying to settle any dispute with Kuwait by force and told the Iraqi leader that the United States would “never excuse settlement of disputes by other than peaceful means”. Moreover, even if Glaspie had given Saddam a “green light” during this meeting, he would almost certainly not have taken this statement at face value given his abiding fear of American perfidy. Saddam smelled an American trap in nearly every initiative launched by Washington and nearly every geopolitical event affecting Iraq. Why would he have now believed that the United States would allow him to dominate the Gulf when it had so assiduously worked to prevent either Iraq or Iran from doing so during the 1980s? We have found nothing in the captured Iraqi documents or recordings indicating that Saddam or his principal advisers perceived a “green light” to invade Kuwait. In fact, the captured documents point in the opposite direction. Lastly as Brands points out, "There is one piece of evidence that merits special mention in this regard – a memo written by President Reagan’s first secretary of state, Alexander Haig, following a trip to the Middle East in April 1981. Summarising his conversations in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, Haig wrote, ‘It was also interesting to confirm that President Carter gave the Iraqis a green light to launch the war against Iran through [Crown Prince] Fahd [of Saudi Arabia].’ Although this document is often taken as confirmation of the green light thesis, the actual meaning of the Haig memo remains murky. As the full context of the document indicates, Haig’s comment about a ‘green light’ was not made as an admission by a US official with direct knowledge of any such scheme – Haig had not been in government in September 1980 – but rather as his characterisation of information reported to him by one of his Arab interlocutors (which interlocutor is not clear). The Haig memo therefore provides hard evidence only of the fact that one of the secretary’s sources believed the green light thesis to be true. Haig himself does not seem to have attached a great deal of importance to this assertion – his memo mentions the seemingly explosive issue only once, in a single sentence, before proceeding to other matters."<sup>[[3]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-7709.2012.01045.x)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/14682745.2011.564612)</sup></sup> Historian  Ibrahim Al-Marashi agrees, "this article debunks the “April Glaspie myth.” 

- During the first Persian Gulf War (1991), U.S. military planners identified Al Firdos C3 Bunker (Amiriyah shelter), as an Iraqi military command and control center. Barbed wire surrounded the complex, it was camouflaged, armed sentries guarded its entrance and exit points, and electronic intelligence identified its activation.  Unknown to coalition planners, some Iraqi civilians used upper levels of the facility as nighttime sleeping quarters. The bunker was bombed, resulting in over 400 civilian deaths. Was there a violation of the LOAC? Not by U.S. forces, but there was a clear violation of the principle of distinction (discussed infra) by Iraqi forces. Based upon information gathered by Coalition planners, the commander made an assessment that the target was a military objective. Although the attack may have resulted in unfortunate civilian deaths, there was no LOAC violation because the attackers acted in good faith based upon the information reasonably available at the time the decision to attack was made. A review of the targeting policies at the time were determined to be proper.<sup>[[1]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=649&skin=2021&q1=Al%20Firdus%20bunker)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://tjaglcs.army.mil/documents/35956/56931/2022+Operational+Law+Handbook.pdf/4e10836e-2399-eb81-768f-7de8f6e03dc5?t=1652119179075)</sup></sup>

- January 1991, it was alleged that USS Nicholas engaged Iraqis on oil platforms who were showing white flags to surrender. This was the case for only a handful of Iraqi personnel who were next to others brandishing weapons at recon helicopters, who were also armed with Surface-to-air missiles and AA Guns. The following day, when the helicopters returned, no white flags were seen, and the demonstrated hostile intent was clear. The USS Nicholas engaged under strict Rules of Engagement and applicable international law.<sup>[[1]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44642452.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A35a8f6a42d0569530172e517dcbd6724)</sup></sup>

- In 1991, the United States and allied countries under UNSCR resolution & strict Rules of Engagement, imposed 3 no-fly zone operations to secure the Kurdish people from slaughter at the hands of the brutal Iraqi regime. This measure allowed the Allied nations to also provide humanitarian aid.<sup>[[1]](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1459&context=ils)</sup></sup>

- In August 1990, Saddam Hussein’s army invaded Kuwait and consequently the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Saddam lied about the effect of these sanctions, by manipulating census data. A study published in BMJ Global Health confirms, "Since 2003, however, several more surveys dealing with child mortality have been undertaken. Their results show no sign of a huge and enduring rise in the under-5 death rate starting in 1991. It is therefore clear that Saddam Hussein’s government successfully manipulated the 1999 survey in order to convey a very false impression—something that is surely deserving of greater recognition."<sup>[[1]](https://gh.bmj.com/content/2/2/e000311)</sup></sup>

- On the morning of July 3, 1988, the USS Montgomery observed “seven IRGC small boats approaching a Pakistani vessel,” which soon increased to 13 boats challenging nearby merchantmen. The USS Vincennes was ordered to the area for support and launched a helicopter, which came under fire. As the situation escalated, two boats turned toward the Vincennes, interpreted as hostile intent, prompting both ships to engage. During the critical seven minutes that Flight 655 was airborne, the Vincennes was involved in a “high-speed surface battle” and monitoring an airborne helicopter that had already been attacked. Additionally, the ship tracked an Iranian P-3 aircraft presenting a targeting profile. Amid this tense environment, an unknown aircraft took off from the same joint military/civilian airport that had launched Iranian F-4s against US forces in April. This unknown aircraft was detected 27 minutes behind any scheduled commercial flights, flying slightly off the typical air corridor and at an altitude consistent with either a hostile or commercial aircraft. The Vincennes received mixed radar signals, initially identifying it with a Mode III IFF squawk before confusing it with a Mode II IFF squawk indicative of an F-14. As it continued toward the Vincennes without responding to distress calls, the situation grew increasingly perilous, culminating in the tragic decision to fire on the aircraft.<sup>[[1]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6660400-1988-Iran-Plane-Crash-Fp.html#document/p1)</sup></sup>

- During the Iran-Iraq war, Iran illegally attacked merchant vessels in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, in international waters. The US suggested, and Kuwait agreed, to re-flag vessels under US protection—thus, escorting them to safety. Rules of Engagement were only respond to attacks, in order to defend. The result, 11 vessels were protected.<sup>[[1]](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA193900.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/tankerwar198088l74walk)</sup></sup>
  
- It has been alleged, that through "Operation Cyclone", the US funded/trained terrorist groups like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, under the umbrella of the Mujahidin—thus also, creating Bin Laden—to combat the illegal Soviet invasion and occupation on Afghanistan. This is a distortion of reality, and is often misunderstood. While it is true the CIA did aid the Mujahidin, they did so only to moderate factions, under strict vetting for human rights compliance & religious views. These moderates, would be known as the Northern Alliance after the Soviet invasion ended. They fought against AQ and Taliban extremists in the 90s, with US assistance. Ultimately, the US reached out again to the Northern Alliance after the events of 9/11, to go after the terrorist groups. CIA had 0 contact or relationship of Bin Laden during the 80s. Indeed, it is the Soviet's illegal invasion of Afghanistan that created Bin Laden. He used his wealth to fund and supply the Afghan Arabs in the Mujahidin. To quote, "Numerous comments in the media recently have reiterated a widely circulated but incorrect notion that the CIA once had a relationship with Usama Bin Laden. For the record, you should know that the CIA never employed, paid, or maintained any relationship whatsoever with Bin Laden."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/static/c40e6e16c1183e0bed3777f048f41d98/Devotion-to-Duty.pdf#page=12)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20050310111109/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20011101020914/http://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/press_release/pr10052001.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/Curator-Pocket-History-CIA.pdf#page=84)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-041-doc01.pdf)</sup></sup> At the cost of millions of lives and billions of dollars.

- In May 1985, a Washington Post article alleged CIA had an indirect role of a car bombing incident in Lebanon in March of that same year. 
 CIA reviewed the matter after examining all files and personnel, and concluded no such connection or foreknowledge existed. This was independently verified by a House Intel Committee investigation. "The Committee's review has uncovered no evidence that any US Intelligence Agency — any US Government Agency — has encouraged or participated in any terrorist activity in Lebanon. Further, the Committee was able to discover no evidence that any US Intelligence agency had foreknowledge of the March 8 bombing outside the residence of Sheik Hussein Fadlallah. Its review of relevant documents and files and its interview of appropriate government officials leads to the conclusion that no US Government complicity, direct or indirect, can be established with respect to the March 8 bombing in Beirut."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP91-00587R000100720055-4.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00965R000807590013-2.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- In 1980s, US had no involvement in the Turkish coup. According to the list's own wiki citation, the alleged source for the claim clarified in a June 2003 interview, "I did not say to Carter "Our boys did it." It is totally a tale, a myth, It is something Birand fabricated. He knows it, too. I talked to him about it." And, "General Kenan Evren said 'the US did not have pre-knowledge of the coup but we informed them of the coup 2 hours in advance due to our soldiers coinciding with the American community JUSMAT that is in Ankara.'" 

- Political pundits and conspiracy theorists claim that the US is to blame for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and that it was justified. However, declassified documents in the landmark series, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1977–1980, Volume XII, Afghanistan, confirms this to be a bogus claim a Kremlin psyops fairytale. The records confirm that in early 1979 the Kremlin started accusing the US of interfering in internal Afghanistan affairs. To quote from the declassified records, "U.S. policy in response to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, a process that began with Moscow’s growing involvement in Afghan politics following the Communist revolution in April 1978 and culminating with the mass influx of Soviet military forces in December 1979. Until the Communist coup that overthrew President Mohammed Daoud Khan, U.S. diplomatic and strategic interest in Afghanistan was minor, and focused largely on stanching the flow of illegal narcotics through that country. Prior to 1978, Washington viewed Afghanistan as a relatively stable and non-aligned country that did not figure prominently in the global Cold War competition. Accordingly, Afghanistan was not a major focal point for the first year and a half of the Carter administration." It goes on to detail how the US Government responded to the Kremlin's propaganda, that projected its actions onto the US, "On March 30, 1979, the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs, Zbigniew Brzezinski, informed Secretary of State Cyrus Vance that he had sent memoranda to the International Communication Agency (ICA) and the CIA relaying how President Jimmy Carter wanted to respond to Soviet allegations that the United States was meddling in Afghan affairs. Brzezinski’s memorandum to Director of Central Intelligence Stansfield Turner, March 30, transmitted Carter’s request to strongly rebuke the Soviet allegation of U.S. involvement in overthrowing the Afghan Government. Brzezinski went on: “All information available to us in recent days has tended to indicate quite the contrary: that the Soviet Union is preparing to intervene in Afghanistan to prop up an unpopular leftist regime and is, in fact, already doing most of the things it is accusing the United States and other countries of doing or preparing to do.” Brzezinski requested a status report by April 6 in response to Carter’s directive." Other documents note, "CIA representatives have been instructed not to delve too deeply with Afghan sources into the theoretical possibility of clandestine support for the rebels, for fear of giving them false signals regarding U.S. intentions."

  Fake history peddlers defend Soviet imperialism, by suggesting the Afghans merely invited Soviets to help out. However, this was another imperialist lie. The declassified files continue, "The Kremlin had lost confidence in the recently ascended Afghan leader Hafizullah Amin. Citing the Brezhnev Doctrine, which held that once a country had turned communist, Moscow would resolve to keep it in the “revolutionary” camp, the Soviet leadership decided to execute a full political and military takeover of Afghanistan. On December 25, 1979, Soviet forces invaded the country and killed Amin in Kabul at the Presidential Palace. Two days later President Carter approved a new covert action to send lethal aid to the Afghan Mujahidin insurgents, rebuked the invasion in a strongly worded letter to Brezhnev, and undertook an array of diplomatic and economic sanctions in consultation with U.S. allies to protest Soviet policy. As one declassified file points out, "The fact that Amin was assassinated within two days of the Soviet invasion makes a mockery of Moscow’s claims that it was invited in by the Amin Government. That Amin’s family was killed along with him shows the kind of people we are dealing with." The records then reveal: "The Afghanistan Covert Action Program began with a Presidential Finding dated 3 July 1979 which authorized humanitarian aid to the insurgents. A second Finding on 7 November expanded the program by authorizing procurement advice and communications equipment. Following the Soviet invasion, a third Presidential Finding dated 28 December expanded the program further by authorizing the provision of lethal military equipment to the insurgents."<sup>[[1]](https://static.history.state.gov/frus/frus1977-80v12/pdf/frus1977-80v12.pdf#page=8)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3093334?origin=crossref)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210928211944/https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000278538.pdf)</sup></sup>

  It is further alleged, that the Carter administration tricked, and trapped Moscow in a Vietnam-style quagmire. The often cited "smoking-gun" evidence for this claim, comes from an interview with French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur in January 1998, former U.S. National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. However, a careful, thorough, and incisive 2020 study reveals this is nothing more than a myth, contradicted by declassified documents, and other critical source examination. "The French interview has had a major impact on the historiography, being used as the almost sole basis to prove the existence of a concerted effort to lure Moscow into the “Afghan trap.” There are, however, significant problems with it as an historical source. First, the title is deceptive. It reads (in translation): “The revelations of a former adviser to Carter: ‘Yes, the CIA came into Afghanistan before the Russians . . .’” Quotation marks and ellipsis indicate that this is a direct quote from Brzezinski and implies CIA operations inside Afghanistan before December 1979, which does not fit with the historical record. Although insisting on the accuracy of the interview, the journalist has since conceded that the quote in the title was not actually from Brzezinski but was “invented” by the editors, which casts doubt on the subsequent text.6 Secondly, the published remarks were heavily edited and Brzezinski has denied the article’s accuracy on numerous occasions, asserting that it was “not an interview, but excerpts from an interview that was originally supposed to be published in full but which they never checked with me for approval in the form that it did appear.”7 It is also likely a casualty of translation—being conducted in English, translated and printed in French, and reconverted to English—with the original statements becoming skewed and distorted in their edited and translated form. Additionally, many of the interview’s claims are unsupported by documentary evidence. For example, Brzezinski has denied he ever sent a note claiming the covert aid would “lead to a Soviet military intervention,” and no such note, nor references to it, has ever been found. Nowhere else has Brzezinski ever referred to a systematic plan for the “Afghan trap” and neither in his subsequent actions, writings, interviews, or public remarks on the topic has he shown any satisfaction that his strategy had worked. It is highly questionable that Brzezinski would attempt to bolster his reputation and disclose information on a secret plan to ensnare Moscow in an Afghan quagmire in just one foreign interview and then subsequently and repeatedly deny it. The editing, translation, inventions, and lack of final approval and corroborating documentation generates doubts on the accuracy of the words attributed to Brzezinski and, ultimately, if this one unreliable interview is discounted there is very little legitimate evidence to back up the “trap” thesis. The nascent covert program was a consequence of the Soviets’ “creeping intervention,” not its cause, and carefully calibrated to avoid provoking an invasion. Brzezinski’s actions through 1979 demonstrated an effort to dissuade intervention through publicizing the growing Soviet presence and warning directly of the consequences of intervention, and his post-invasion actions belie the argument that bogging down the Soviets in an unrelenting insurgency was his objective. The limited pre-invasion covert program is wholly insignificant to charge the Carter administration with actively attempting to induce an invasion, and thus causing the subsequent decades of destabilization in Afghanistan. It is, as Mondale wrote, “a huge, unwarranted leap to conclude that the CIA plan was designed to provoke a Soviet intervention when we were, in fact, trying to discourage one."<sup>[[4]](https://academic.oup.com/dh/article-abstract/44/2/237/5699276?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged that the US Government sold out, and abandoned the Kurds in 1975. However, a critical review of the declassified records finds no basis in this charge. As one world-renowned scholar Bryan Gibson, "Despite the widely held view that the United States sold the Kurds out in March 1975, the decision was presented as a fait accompli. While Kissinger had known that the Shah was considering abandoning the Kurds, he believed that he had talked him out of it. At least, this was the thrust of Kissinger’s letter to Barzani in February 1975, when he agreed to meet with a Kurdish emissary. Nevertheless, Kissinger saw the Kurdish intervention as a valuable means of advancing US Middle Eastern strategy. After all, the Kurdish intervention had tied down Iraq’s army during the October War, allowed Kissinger to secure Israel’s disengagement from Syria, and prevented the formation of a strong Iraqi government. In the end, Kissinger’s frustration upon learning that the Shah had ignored his advice and had reached agreement with Saddam Hussein in Algiers is explained by his belief that the Kurds were a valuable Cold War card, to be used to advance US interests, while denying the Soviet Union a strong base of influence. This study shows that both the Pike Report and William Safire’s highly critical articles have had a distorting effect on the historiographical discourse on the Kurdish War. The primary objective of the US operation was to increase the Kurds’ bargaining power with Baghdad in order to help them secure reasonable terms on autonomy. Nevertheless, both the Pike Report and Safire’s articles do not represent an objective assessment of the Ford administration’s handling of the Kurdish intervention. This study has shown that the Pike Report ignored inconvenient truths; manipulated evidence; misattributed quotes; falsely accused the United States of not providing the Kurds with any humanitarian assistance;  and, finally, claimed that Kissinger had not responded to Barzani’s tragic plea,  when in fact he had. None of these claims appeared to be substantiated. As Gerald Haines argues, the Pike Report’s real purpose was to expose the CIA as a “rogue elephant” and scale back the White House’s control over foreign policy. In other words, this was not the “textbook case of betrayal and skullduggery” that the Pike Report had led many people to believe."<sup>[[1]](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137517159)</sup></sup>

- During the 1974 Cyprus crisis, Nixon issued a last-ditch diplomatic effort via a stern warning letter to the Turkish Government to prevent an invasion of Cyprus. This letter reflected that of the Lyndon B. Johnson letter that prevented the invasion in 1964. However, the Ambassador to Turkey did not transmit the letter to Turkey. A study finds, "In his own approach to Turkey, though, Kissinger wanted to appeal to reason rather than fear. He mainly sought to deconstruct the Turkish assumption that the military solution would leave Turkey better off in Cyprus."<sup>[[1]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.2021.1935293)</sup></sup> It is also clear from the declassified record the US had no connection to the coup itself, the "American conspiracy" has been thoroughly debunked in academia.<sup>[[2]](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/85/1/129/2326023?redirectedFrom=PDF)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v30/d171)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v30/d148)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80M01133A000800100026-2.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://ia802301.us.archive.org/12/items/document-12-deputy-director-of-policy-planning/Document-12-Deputy-Director-of-Policy-Planning.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://ia600100.us.archive.org/26/items/dismantled-cyprus-conspiracy/US%20role%20in%20Cyprus%20Crisis.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- Despite many allegations, no evidence exists that the US provided covert arms support either or both sides of the Iran-Iraq conflict. Declassified CIA files have confirmed that the USSR was a major supplier for chemical weapons and other gear to Iraq.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170124020754/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90T01298R000300670001-8.pdf)</sup></sup> The US led the global embargo effort against Iraq to prevent it from acquiring chemical weapons. CIA, naturally, monitored the conflict—it is after all—the _Central Intelligence Agency_.<sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP81B00401R000500030002-5.pdf)</sup></sup> Some conspiracy theorists and their historical revisionist supporters, suggest that there was indeed evidence of covert weapons aid: Edward A. Johnson was convicted of crimes which focused on sales between 1982 and 1987 to Chilean purchasers of zirconium which was made into cluster bombs sold to Iraq. Although the export of the zirconium for this purpose was prohibited by laws of the United States, Johnson sought to defend the charges against him by establishing that the United States — in particular, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the Central Intelligence Agency and high ranking members of the military — encouraged the Teledyne companies, Johnson's employers, to export the zirconium, knowing the purchasers would use it to manufacture cluster bombs for Iraq, because at that time the United States was secretly supporting Iraq in its war with Iran.

  However, the Courts carefully and fully examined the classified record, including the Howard Teicher's declaration—and found no such thing ever happened: "The court carefully reviewed classified government documents and found no evidence supporting Johnson's theory that the CIA had secretly arranged to supply Cardoen with zirconium. After our own review of these classified materials, we agree with the district court that the government did not withhold any evidence supporting Johnson's "CIA" theory."<sup>[[3]](https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/19955021.OPN.pdf)</sup></sup> Not only did the Courts find the claim meritless, but it gets worse: Howard Teicher admitted he was wrong after prosecutors examined NSC holdings, in a sworn affidavit. SFgate bogusly claimed in a 2003 article that he recanted only after threats of indictment. Not only did SFgate cite nothing for this cope, it makes no sense: Robert Gates, in the 1991 confirmation hearings, while holding the position of White House Deputy Assistant for National Security Affairs, officially acknowledged, himself, CIA's limited actions of providing few tactical intelligence in specific battles. So, there was nothing to threaten with indictment over.

  In 1991, the Senate Intelligence Committee directed FBI and the Inspector General to investigate allegations during the confirmation hearings for Gates—as well as their own review. The result of the FBI, IG and SSCI investigations: "No credible evidence has been presented to the Committee to support these allegations... There is no evidence to indicate that the CIA, or any other entity of the U.S. government, supplied arms or related military equipment or technology to Iraq. However, it is clear that proposals to provide such assistance were considered and rejected. SSCI also refuted allegations concerning BCCI, Carlos Gardoen, Theberge, and Ari Ben Menache.<sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/gates-iraq)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://archive.org/details/bcci-affair)</sup></sup>

  In 1993, Senate Intelligence Committee found, "the inquiry also produced no evidence that CIA had been operationally involved in assisting the Iraqi procurement network or had any involvement in the financial arrangements to support military or civil projects in Iraq." This nothing-burger, fake scandal is also dubbed 'Iraqgate'.<sup>[[6]](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/10312.pdf#page=12)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1149134)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/20/opinion/l-making-a-scandal-where-none-exists-325095.html)</sup></sup>

  Also as part of the "Iraqgate" conspiracy theory, it is alleged that the Federal Reserve facilitated a $5.5 billion loan to Iraq for weapons purchases during the 1980s—and interfered with investigations. Central to this is BNL-atlanta. BNL-Atlanta, one of five U.S. offices operated by Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, a large Italian bank headquartered in Rome, was involved in $5.5 billion of unauthorized credit activity largely to benefit Iraq in the 1980s. BNL-Atlanta did not document the purposes of all of its loans to Iraq, leading to allegations that Iraq used the funds for weapons purchases. On August 4, 1989, the FBI, assisted by Federal Reserve representatives, executed a search warrant on BNL-Atlanta and uncovered evidence that it had engaged in unauthorized credit transactions with Iraq. The federal authorities initiated the search of BNL-Atlanta based on information provided by two BNL-Atlanta employees. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia created and led an investigative task force (BNL Task Force), which consisted of representatives from the FBI, the Federal Reserve, Customs and Border Protection, USDA’s OIG, and the Internal Revenue Service. Bank examiners from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta were detailed to the BNL Task Force to contribute their knowledge and experience in banking and regulatory compliance. The BNL Task Force conducted an extensive investigation into the size and scope of BNL-Atlanta’s unauthorized transactions and identified $5.5 billion in unauthorized credit activity largely to benefit Iraq. The purpose of some of BNL-Atlanta’s loans to Iraq was to finance the export of U.S. agricultural products through a USDA export guarantee program run by the CCC.

  The BNL Task Force investigation spanned several years and ultimately resulted in criminal charges and prosecutions of multiple BNL-Atlanta employees, including the manager, Christopher Drogoul, as well as Vice Presidents Paul Von Wedel, Thomas Fiebelkorn, and Therese Barden. The Federal Reserve imposed a consent cease and desist order that required Banca Nazionale del Lavoro to maintain an additional reserve deposit equivalent to a reserve deficiency payment of $5.2 million at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta for 18 months. The BNL Task Force final report, published in October 1994, reviewed criminal allegations relating to BNL-Atlanta’s credit extensions to Iraq and government actions taken in connection with exports to Iraq. The BNL Task Force final report stated, “We did not find evidence that U.S. agencies or officials illegally armed Iraq or that crimes were committed through bartering of CCC commodities for military equipment.”

  The Inspector general report concludes, "We did not find any evidence of undue political interference with Federal Reserve officials related to Iraq weapons purchases during the 1980s or any indications that the Federal Reserve facilitated any loans to Iraq through BNL-Atlanta for weapons purchases during the 1980s.

  Other conspiracy theorists have also claimed that Main Justice in Washington, with the aid of the CIA, deliberately withheld important information that may have affected the prosecution of employees of the BNL-Atlanta. Specifically, it is alleged that they withheld information that individuals in the Rome headquarters of BNL had contemporaneous knowledge of unlawful activities at BNL-Atlanta, and that the United States and Italian governments were also knowledgeable of, or even involved in, those activities. It Is further alleged that this information was withheld from the Court presiding over the BNL matter, and from the prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Georgia ("USAO"). To investigate these claims, Judge Frederick B. Lacey was appointed Independent Counsel. His investigation studies first, the Initial requests for, and review of, intelligence information in the BNL case by the DOJ and the USAO from 1990 through August of 1992. Also examined is the process by which that information was gathered and disseminated by US Intelligence organizations, including the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the NSA, National Security Council and the State Department. The Report then considers the events that occurred in September 1992 that gave rise to the allegations at issue. Finally, the Report analyzes all these facts and reaches conclusions.

  In conclusion to Volume 1, "scrutiny of all other conduct addressed in this Report, found no credible evidence that any person in the DOJ or the USAO acted to obstruct the due administration of justice in connection with a judicial, congressional of any other proceeding, of to sake any false statements to any department or agency of the United States." In conclusion for volume 2, "1. There is no evidence that the DOJ withheld any intelligence Information from the USAO. However, there is evidence of inadequate procedures and a careless approach to Intelligence information that must be corrected. 2. The statement in the September 11, 1992 Sentencing Memorandum is not incorrect or misleading. However, its method of preparation reflected a lack of due care. 3. The September 17 CIA letter was incomplete, but I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that Mueller and Urgenson lacked the intent to conceal of mislead. There is also clear and convincing evidence that the September 18 CIA statement was not withheld for any improper reason. 4. The DIA's September 11 letter and the Brill September 21 statement do not give rise to any claim of wrongdoing by any DOJ official."<sup>[[10]](https://archive.org/details/bnl-independent-counsel_202312)</sup></sup> The 1993 Senate Intelligence Committee report independently corroborates Judge Frederick B. Lacey's findings, "The investigation produced no evidence to indicate that the failure to identify these reports earlier had been a deliberate act on the part of CIA."<sup>[[11]](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/10312.pdf#page=28)</sup></sup> As did the Inspector General.<sup>[[12]](https://ia802903.us.archive.org/26/items/bnl-independent-counsel_202312/BNL%20independent%20Counsel.pdf#page=342)</sup></sup> Lastly, the SSCI ruled, "This inquiry produced no evidence of CIA complicity in, or knowledge of, the illegal activities which allegedly took place at BNL-Atlanta prior to August, 1989."<sup>[[13]](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/10312.pdf#page=12)</sup></sup>

  Misleading headlines claimed that a Commerce official edited license data, which had originally characterised trucks as "military" to "commercial". However, the Inspector General's report provides details that, as expected: the conspiracy theorists ignore the inconvenient details: It says, "The export regulations provide an export control commodity number and general description for each commodity to be exported. Bureau personnel changed the commodity description for trucks from "vehicles designed for military use" to "commercial utility cargo trucks" or "vehicles." The former term is consistent with the terns used in the export administration regulations as the general description of the trucks. We found no changes to general descriptions of other licensed commodities that made them inconsistent with the regulations. A Bureau official told us the commodity descriptions were changed to clarify that the Bureau does not license the sale of military trucks. The official also said that the description changes were justified by a State Department letter to an exporter in 1983. The letter indicates that the exporter's trucks, which were intended for sale to Iraq, were classified as "commercial utility cargo trucks."

  We disagree with both reasons for changing the commodity descriptions. The export administration regulations allow the Bureau to approve licenses for the sale of military trucks that are not on the U. S. Munitions List. Such vehicles are primarily transport vehicles designed for noncombat military purposes. Additionally, when we discussed the contents of the 1983 letter with State Department officials, they informed us that the letter provides no justification for the description changes. It merely informed the exporter that the trucks are not on the munitions list and can be licensed by the Bureau. Bureau personnel changed five licenses for trucks, including the two that we found. The total value of the licensed trucks was over $1 billion, or approximately 2/3 of the total value of the approved export licenses for Iraq during the period under review. In fact, more than 97 percent of the total value of the changed licenses is accounted for by changes to the truck licenses. Although the licenses were approved, Bureau personnel informed us that no licensed trucks have been shipped." This is to say, Kloske, who was responsible for the edit, was simply incorrect. Only trucks on the munitions list were prohibited, not non-combat military trucks. Thus, as the IG found, "the changes were unjustified." The Independent Counsel report finds, "clear and convincing evidence that no improper motive existed." Further, a critical detail often ignored: "No trucks were shipped."<sup>[[14]](https://archive.org/details/usdaoig-iraq)</sup></sup>

  This is corroborated by a 1994 GAO investigation—which examined all US exports to Iraq in the 1980s. Of note, "In five instances, third parties requested the United States to allow them to transfer military equipment to Iraq. In 1982, a Middle East country asked that it be allowed to transfer U.S.-origin howitzers and C-130 aircraft to Iraq. In the same year, a European country requested that the United States sell howitzers, and cobra and Blackhawk helicopters to Iraq, using it as the intermediary. State turned down both requests, citing the U.S. policy of not aiding either belligerent in the Iran-Iraq War. In 1983, another country requested battle tanks from the United States so that it could, in turn, send its Soviet-made tanks to Iraq. According to a DOD official, who was working for State when this request was made, the United States turned down the request. In 1986, a Middle East country requested the purchase of night vision devices for Iraqi helicopters, using it as the conduit. In January 1990, another Middle East country requested permission to transfer $4OO,OOO in U.S-origin howitzer spare parts to Iraq. The United States turned down both of these requests, again citing the policy of not aiding either belligerent in the Iran-Iraq War."<sup>[[15]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-94-98.pdf)</sup></sup>

- CIA had no involvement in Saddam's rise to power. According to the world's most authoritative examination, "New documentary revelations have helped clear up various claims made about the CIA’s operations inside Iraq during 1961–62. It has been suggested, for instance, that the CIA urged the Kurds to rebel against Baghdad in this period; however, documents reveal that US diplomats and intelligence officers in the field had warned Washington of an impending war and were ignored. Furthermore, evidence from Soviet archives suggests that Soviet intelligence officers might have urged Barzani to fight in 1961. It has also been alleged that the CIA tried to “incapacitate” Qasim in 1961–62 by mailing him a poisoned handkerchief, but again the evidence suggests that Mahdawi, the pro-communist head of the People’s Court, would have been a more likely target. Finally, it has been widely believed that the CIA was behind the Ba’thist coup that overthrew Qasim in February 1963. The CIA was indeed plotting against Qasim in the 1962–63 period; nonetheless, it has also been uncovered that the CIA was also engaged in a major intelligence gathering operation, which was primarily aimed at gaining information about Soviet antiaircraft weaponry. With access to a virtual “intelligence bonanza” at stake, the Kennedy administration showed great reluctance about aggravating Qasim. Such a bold move, like overthrowing the Iraqi government, would have probably been deemed too risky at the time. Moreover, a high-level CIA official, who claimed to have helped plot Qasim’s demise, has divulged that the CIA’s plans to overthrow Qasim had not yet been finalized when the Ba’th Party seized power. In sum, barring the release of new information, the preponderance of evidence substantiates the conclusion that the CIA not behind the February 1963 Ba’thist coup." Gibson continues, "the preponderance of evidence substantiates the conclusion that the CIA was not behind the February 1963 Ba’thist coup.... While it has been suggested that the United States instigated the revolt to undermine the Qasim regime, evidence shows the opposite. The Shelepin memo suggests that the Soviets had hoped to use Iraq’s Kurdish minority to distract the United States and its allies from the Berlin Crisis by threatening America’s regional allies, Iran and Turkey, both of which had large Kurdish minorities. In reality, the origins of the revolt were largely indigenous, relating mostly to Qasim’s failed land reforms and his divide-and-rule tactics." Other scholars like Peter Hahn observes that "no declassified US documents support this claim."

  It is also alleged that the CIA provided lists of communists and leftists to the Ba’th Party in the early 60s. Hanna Batatu, a Palestinian Marxist historian finds the Ba’th had “ample opportunity to gather such particulars in 1958–59, when the Communists came wholly into the open." Gibson and others concur, "This explanation actually makes perfect sense and is supported by documents that suggest the Ba’th Party had created its own lists during 1958–59. For instance, an INR analysis from February 15 stated, '[Communist] party members [are being] rounded up on the basis of lists prepared by the now-dominant Ba’th Party.' A separate INR analysis from February 21 pointed out that during the 1958–59 period, the communists had “exposed virtually all its assets” whom the Ba’th had “carefully spotted and listed.”<sup>[[1]](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137517159)</sup></sup>
  
- US had no involvement in the Suez crisis of 1956. To quote from an authoritative, independent internal study, "Without American support or knowledge, two staunch U.S. allies, in collusion with Israel, plotted to go to war for a cause the Eisenhower administration believed was rash, unjustified, and potentially very dangerous. Ultimately, France, Britain, and Israel would become the overt aggressors against Egypt. As a result, the United States was in the awkward position of siding with Nasser against its allies."<sup>[[1]](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2013-117-doc01.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/suez)</sup></sup>

- 1953, Iran. The list [claims](https://imgur.com/a/ZckJs0s) that the CIA "replaced" Mossadeq with the Shah. It should be obviously clear why this is a display of full ignorance: Who appointed him? Due to many myths and sensational headlines, great detail is needed to provide background, context and clarify actual events as they actually happened. Furher, yes, the CIA did admit involvement—however, it would be a stretch to call it a coup. It was "an exercise of the Shah's constitutional prerogative and authority. Mossadeq's failure to abide by the firmans would make his tenure as Prime Minister illegal." Since conspiracy theorists and pundits like to reference headlines on what the "CIA admits", the following will be direct quotes from two authoritative documents only:

  "An Islamic fundamentalist assassinated Iranian Prime Minister General Ali Razmara on 7 March 1951. Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi—who had become Shah when his father, Reza Shah, abdicated in 1941-appointed Mossadeq as Prime Minister on 29 April1 951. Shah's initial choice to succeed Razmam, Hussein Ala, had resigned after only a few weeks. Severe economic and political problems awaited the Mossndeq, and it was not obvious that he had the skill to solve them. Mossadeq's immediate concern was a struggle for control of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). By 1950 the British oil concession in Iran, which the Shah had renewed in 1949, was a sore point in relations between the two countries. In March 1951, when Mossadeq was a member of the Majlis (the Iranian Parliament), he submitted a bill, which the Majlis quickly passed, nationalizing AIOC. He signed the bill into law on 1 May 1951, just three days after the Shah appointed him Prime Minister. Nationalization went into effect on 2 May 1951 and was made retroactive to 20 March 1951. AIOC's nationalization brought Mossadeq and Iran into immediate conflict with Britain. The British government owned half of AIOC's stock and did not intend to let Mossadeq nationalize its assets without adequate compensation as required under international law. 

  The flash point came in July 1952, when Mossadeq resigned during a dispute over whether the Shah or the Prime Minister should appoint the war minister. During the elections for the 17th Majlis earlier in the year, vote-tampering by the Iranian Royal Court had convinced Mossadeq that the government's survival depended on control of the military. On 16 July he demanded the right to appoint himself (unconstitutionally) minister of war. The Shah refused and Mossadeq resigned. Mossadeq's resignation initially appeared to be a shrewd political move that underscored his mastery of Iranian politics and his ability to gauge and exploit public opinion. The Shah appointed Ahmad Qavam, Prime Minister during the Azeri crisis with the Soviet Union in 1947, to succeed Mossadeq. In response, the National Front, a broad coalition formed in 1949, organized mass demonstrations in Tehran demanding Mossadeq's return. The demonstrations turned violent-69 people died and more than 750 were injured-but the Shah refused to use the police or the military to restore order. Qavam lacked broad support and was unable to organize counter-demonstrations. For five days the National Front controlled the streets of Tehran and other cities. On 21 July 1952 the Shah bowed to the pressure and replaced Qavam with Mossadeq. Once back in power, Mossadeq struck back at the Shah and the military. He transferred Reza Shah's lands back to the State, appointed himself Minister of War, forced the Shah's twin sister Princess Ashraf to leave the country, and forbade Mohammed Reza Pahlavi from communicating directly with foreign diplomats. By May 1953, according to Iranian specialist Ervand Abrahamian, "the shah had been stripped of all the powers he had fought for and recovered since August 1941." The Prime Minister also seized the opportunity to purge the Iranian officer corps. He forcibly retired many Royalist officers, and cut the military budget 15%. To add to the insult, Mossadeq transferred 15,000 men from the military to the Gendarmerie, the military's bureaucratic rival. These acts fueled smoldering resentment among the dismissed officers and those few royalists escaping Mossadeq's purge.  Mossadeq's apparent political triumph rapidly turned sour. The National Front began to unravel in late 1952 and early 1953 as the Prime Minister grew increasingly dictatorial. By November 1952, Ayatollah Abul Quasscm Kashani, a key Islamic cleric in the National Front, had turned against Mossadeq and quit the Front, as had Mozaffar Baqai's Toilers' Party. Kashani's defection was a particularly hard blow because his group, the Warriors of Islam, included the bazaar merchants of Tehran and many mullahs (Islamic clerics). Support from these two groups historically has been critical to Iranian governments.

  The reasons for the defections were complex. Although 30 of the 79 deputies of the 17th Majlis, convened in February 1952, belonged to or identified with the National Front, they represented different constituencies and interests were united only in their opposition to the British. In addition, nationalization of the AIOC did not produce the bonanza for Iran that Mossadeq had hoped it would. He began to demand more and more power from the Majlis, and when the legislature granted the Prime Minister what amounted to dictatorial powers, Ayatollah Kashani resigned as Majlis speaker. Toilers' Party leader Mozaffar Baqai compared Mossadeq to Hitler and praised the army as a bulwark against Communism. As support for Mossndeq narrowed, the Tudeh would soon be the only group willing to take to the streets on his behalf. Ayatollah Kashani's defection and increased squabbling among the deputies effectively paralysed the Majlis. Opposition politicians-including former Mossadeq allies like Kashani-blocked the Prime Minister's legislation. In early June 1953, fistfights broke out in the Majlis. The Prime Minister won a temporary victory when Abdullah Moazemi, a Mossadeq supporter, succeeded Kashani as speaker in a close Majlis vote (41 to 31) on 1 July 1953. Mossadeq recognized, however, that the Majlis was hopelessly deadlocked and that dissolution and new elections were necessary to break the stalemate. Under the Iranian constitution only the Shah could dissolve the Majlis. The government could request him to do so. Mossadeq knew the Shah would not agree to such a proposal, so he devised a plan to achieve the same end. He asked all National Front members and supporters to resign, which they did, and simultaneously announced the dissolution of the Majlis. The Iranian people, he held, could ratify or reject his decision in a referendum on the theory that popular will superseded the constitution. Iranian scholar Ervand Abrahamian has noted the irony in Mossadeq's rationale. "Mossadeq, the constitutional lawyer who had meticulously quoted the fundamental laws against the shah," Abrahamian wrote, "was now bypassing the same laws and resorting to the theory of the general will." From 3 to 10 August 1953, Iranians voted on Mossadeq's bold and unconstitutional act. The results of the rigged election were never in doubt. Mossadeq purposely excluded rural areas from the balloting, ostensibly because it would take too long to count the votes from remote areas. The ballot was not secret, and there were separate polling places for "yes" and "no ." In the end, Mossadeq claimed victory, gaining "over 2,043,300 of the 2,044,600 ballots cast throughout the country and 101,396 of the 101,463 ballots cast in the capital." The dissolution of the Majlis and the tainted referendum alienated Iranian liberals and conservatives alike. Jamal Imami, a pro-British member of the Majlis, warned that Mossadeq was leading the country toward anarchy. Ayatollah Kashani declared the referendum illegal under Islamic religious law.

  A US Embassy assessment cabled to Washington shortly after the referendum stated that the dissolution of the Majlis "will graphically demonstrate truism of Mossadeq's regime that as opposition and discontent have mounted, Mossadeq has moved steadily in authoritarian direction using technique of mobocracy to maintain his hold on power and to eliminate influence Shah." Nonetheless, the Embassy thought Mossadeq's continued appeals to the street could boomerang because he lacked "any real authoritarian organization aside from armed forces." To compensate. according to the Embassy. he would be forced to rely increasingly on the Tudeh. thereby alienating the non-Communist followers of his Government.

  US perspective: 

  Mossadeq Looks for American Support: Secretary of State Acheson thought that the British were overly preoccupied with their oil interests and that London did not fully understand the broader Communist threat. He saw Mossadeq as a potentially important part of the solution to the problem of Soviet influence in the Middle East. In Acheson's view, the Iranian Prime Minister would in time become an effective bulwark against Soviet penetration into Iran. To that end, Washington consistently urged London to reach an equitable settlement with Tehran. Acheson apparently was convinced that an agreement would strengthen the Iranian government and promote regional stability. The suggestion that British forces might occupy the port city of Abadan or launch some other military action against Iran set off alarms in ONE. In an April 1951 memorandum to DCI Lt. Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, ONE chief Dr. William Langer warned that the appearance of British troops in Iran might result in Soviet occupation of the norther part of the country under the terms of the 1921 treaty of friendship between Persia and Soviet Russia. Neither Langer nor any of the Iran specialists in CIA's clandestine service the Office of Special Operations (OSO), and the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) thought the Tudeh was strong enough by itself to topple Mossadeq. As long as the central government remained able to deal with events, Langer and others saw the danger of a Tudeh coup as negligible. "Tudeh represents a serious threat in view of the opportunities awaiting it," OSO and OPC specialists agreed in January 1952, "but does not yet have the intention or the ability to gain actual control of the government at this time either by force or political means." CIA's operators thought that the Tudeh would come to power only through chaos and impotent central authority. Although the documents in CIA's files do not indicate that Smith relayed Langer's concerns to President Truman, he evidently did so because the administration subsequently let London know that the US Government disapproved of any military action against Iran. At a British cabinet meeting in September 1951, the government of Prime Minister Clement Attlee decided that it "could not afford to break with the United States on an issue of this kind." As of 30 July 1952, the State Department and CIA were committed to supporting Mossadeq. That evening, CIA representatives met at the State Department with Secretary of State Acheson, Under Secretary of State David K.E. Bruce, Charles Bohlen, Henry Byroade, John Jemegan, and Robert Joyce, all of the State Department.40 The participants decided that "It is the policy of the Department of State to maintain the present government in Iran so long as this government has the authority to govern, or until it appears certain that the government will be taken over by the Communists."


  As the foregoing indicates, Washington and London had fundamentally different perspectives on the events in Iran and on their consequences worldwide. These differences complicated the State Department's and Foreign Office's search for a common policy. At times the problems must have appeared insolvable. In January 1952 an internal memorandum in the State Department's Office of Greek, Turkish, and Iranian Affairs identified two areas of disagreement. The United States and the United Kingdom had differing views on the strength of nationalism in Iran (and therefore on Mossadeg's political strength), and on the global consequences of Tehran's failure to reach an oil settlement with London. The State Department recognized that Iranian nationalism was a potent and growing force, making an oil settlement on British terms unattainable even if Mossadeg fell. In contrast, the British disparaged Iranian nationalism as merely a "passing storm." It had no roots and would "pass and its leaders fall as soon as it is demonstrated that their policies have brought Iran to the brink of ruin." More specifically, American officials feared that a British failure to compromise with Mossadeq would enable him to whip up Iran's virulent nationalism further, with potentially disastrous results. The West might well lose so much of its influence that it could not stop Tehran from moving the Soviet orbit. Or the Iranian political situation could simply descend into chaos, in which case the Soviet-backed Tudeh-Iran's best organized, best financed, and most effective political organization- would be ready to fill the vacuum. In the State Department's view, such developments would jeopardize the security and stability of the entire Middle East, would serve notice that the West could not preserve the independence of important Third World states, and could deprive the West not only of Iran's oil but ultimately that of its Arab neighbors as well. 

  The only suggestion for resolving these differences offered in the State Department's internal memorandum further consultation to determine the "political, military, economic, and psychological effects of the loss of Iran to the west as balanced against the political and economic effects of an agreement with the Iranians on the oil situation which might prejudice other concessions elsewhere and diminish British prestige throughout the world." The memorandum concluded that unless the US and United Kingdom agreed on the importance to the West of an independent Iran, there was little chance the two would be able to forge a common policy. Eleven months later the National Security Council set forth basic US policy toward Iran. NSC 136/1 emphasized that the United States was committed to preventing Iran from falling under communist control and that Iran's strategic position, its oil, and its vulnerability to Soviet political subversion or military attack made it a tempting target for Soviet expansion. If the Tudeh Party seized or attempted to seize control of the Iranian government, the document argued, the United States should, in conjunction with the British, be ready to support a non-communist Iranian government militarily, economically, diplomatically, and psychologically. The collapse of the Anglo-Iranian oil negotiations had changed the Americans' attitude; Washington now considered Mossadcq a source of instability and feared that his continued tenure invited a Tudeh coup. The United States suspected the Soviets of trying to take advantage of the deteriorating situation in Iran. In the US view, Soviet leaders undoubtedly saw Mossadeq's troubles as a diplomatic opening, and if he wanted to try to play Moscow against Washington, the Soviets would let him. The Kremlin would help him. The potential benefits to the Soviets of cultivating Mossadcq were great: a docile southern neighbor at a minimum, and beyond that, a chance to draw a strategically important country into the Soviet sphere of influence.

  TPAJAX:

  Initial plans involved a military coup that would, because of the Shah's participation, be fundamentally legal. The Shah's role would be to sign 3 documents: a royal decree (firman, in Farsi) naming Zahedi as Army Chief of Staff; another firman appealing to all ranks of the army to carry out the orders of the new Chief of Staff; and, an open letter calling on army officers to support the bearer, General Zahedi. The letter would be used by Zahedi to recruit the coup group of officers in key posts that would enable them to carry out all military objectives of the plan. However, State set forth two conditions that had to be met: 1) the United States must be prepared to offer immediate and substantial economic assistance--an estimated $60 million the first year--to the new government in Iran in order to stabilize the economy and convince the public that their new government would be able to do more for them than the old one, and 2) the British must give a firm commitment to be flexible in approaching the oil settlement and not attempt to force the new government to accept terms that would alienate public opinion. To be acceptable, State said, the oil settlement should recognize nationalization of the oil industry, provide for Iranian control of all property, installations, and production in Iran, allow the Iranian. government complete freedom of choice of technical and managerial personnel as well as freedom in the sales of oil and oil product, and dispose of the problem of compensation within the framework of the existing nationalization law and on a basis which would not saddle Iran with excessive indebtedness to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Probably the biggest question mark for TAJAX planners was the Shah's role in the coup--not only how he would play it, but would he even play it at all? They had little reason to be overconfident, for his indecision and susceptibility to bad advice were notorious. The Shah had his reasons, however. He had assumed the throne in 1941 when his father, a semiliterate strongman, was forced to abdicate by the occupying power, Britain and the USSR. Leader of a defeated and humiliated country for the first 42 years of his reign, the young Shah attempted to survive by ruling as a constitutional monarch. His very existence was threatened by Tudeh on the left and by Premier Ahmed Qavam on the right; a British correspondent who interviewed him in 1947 described him as "a very frightened young man." Although Qavam, as a strong Premier, was in a position to bring the Pahlavi dynasty to a premature end, he apparently decided to keep the monarchy and took steps to build up the Shah's popularity, crediting him with recovering Azarbaijan from the Soviets. Seemingly stimulated by this appearance of success, the Shah took a more active role as rule, and in 1947 began to intervene more vigorously in political affairs. The attempted assassination by a Tudeh Party member in 1949 frightened him again, but he survived the shots and cast about for some stabilizing factors in his situation. The U.S. Embassy made this assessment of him in 1951: The Shah is confused, frustrated, suspicious, proud, and stubborn, a young man who lives in the shadow of his father. His fears, questioning, and indecisiveness are permanent instabilities of character. Yet, he has great personal courage, many Western ideals, and a sincere, though often wavering, desire to raise and preserve his country. He is, at all times, eager for and a victim of advice.

  The first phase of the operation began on 15 July 1953, when Asadollah Rashidian went to the French Riviera to meet Princess Ashraf. He explained to her that Mossadeq posed a continuing danger for Iran and that she should convince her brother to dismiss. him. She was unenthusiastic. The Princess also was convinced that Mossadeq would do whatever he could to prevent her return. She had already written to the Prime Minister three times, saying that she wanted to come back to Iran because she could no longer afford to live in Europe. When she saw, with some prompting, that a surreptitious visit to the Shah might improve her chances of returning home permanently, she began to warm to the idea. Princess Ashraf arrived in Tehran on 25 July 1953 and met with her brother four days later. She was unable to convince him to sign the firmans and left Tehran the following day.

  In the early days of August, Roosevelt compelled to build up the pressure on the Shah. Alterations were made in the original plan with regard to the firmans the Shah was to sign; one was to name Zahedi as Chief of Staff, while the other would declare illegal the referendum dissolving the Majlis. But, getting the actual documents signed was becoming a critical matter. saw the Shah on 2 August and left the palace believing he had obtained the Shah's agreement to dismiss Mosadeq and appoint Zahedi as Premier, but when Roosevelt met with the ruler the following day, he had become reluctant to act, saying that he was not an adventurer and could not take chances like one. Roosevelt's argument was that the government could be changed in no other way, and that if the Shah did not join with the army to oust Mosader, either a Communist Iran or another Korean-type conflict was inevitable: These alternatives the United States, was not prepared to accept. At this meeting, the Shah asked for direct assurance from President Eisenhower that he approved of the Shah's taking the initiative against Mosadeq, but before this could be passed to Washington, the President fortuitously inserted an item in his speech to the Governors' Conference in Seattle on 4 August to the effect that the United States could not sit idly by and watch Iran fall behind the iron Curtain. Roosevelt used the coincidence of this speech by telling the Shah that the President's comment on Iran had been made to satisfy him, but the ruler continued to balk. On 3 August, the Shah, still irresolute, told Roosevelt that he would send a message of encouragement to the army officers involved, then go to the palace at Ramsar on the Caspian and let the army act, apparently without his official knowledge. If that action were successful, he would name Zahedi as Premier. but the Shah said that while he approved of the planned action, he would not sign any documents. The next part remains classified, however, continues, 'Under this extreme pressure, the Shah finally agreed to sign the papers, see Zahedi personally, and then leave for Ramsar. The next day he did meet with the general, but the firmans were not yet ready to be signed. The Shah went on to Ramsar, after promising to sign the decrees as soon as they were brought to him. Roosevelt then altered the plan one final time by deciding that one firman should dismiss Mosadeg from the Premier's post and the other name Zahedi as his successor.
  
  The Shah's firmans changed the entire character of TPAJAX. No longer was the operation essentially a military coup with the aim of installing Zahedi as Chief of the General Staff and then Prime Minister. Now it was an exercise of the Shah's constitutional prerogative and authority. Mossadeq's failure to abide by the firmans would make his tenure as Prime Minister illegal. The Shah's decrees were now in the hands of the coup group, and the next step was to implement the military action plan as soon as possible. One point seems clear, although the exact details are missing—the initial coup attempt was betrayed. Rumors of a coup to be staged by the army had been in the air for some time, and the Iranians' desultory view of security and their tendency to be talkative were notorious, but according to Roosevelt, it was probably chief of the secret police, who told Chief of Staff Riahi that the coup was coming the night of 15 August. What happened to the other coup officers with assigned missions? A number of them heard the news that the coup was blown and so did nothing. Others were frustrated by the precautions General Riahi took when he learned the coup was coming that night. On Monday the 17th, the Shah did make a number of statements that were broadcast over the Baghdad radio, insisting that he had not abdicated, that he was confident of the loyalty to him of the Iranian people, and that he had indeed dismissed Premier Mosadeq and appointed Zahedi under his constitutional prerogatives.

  Foreign Minister Fatemi, who had been released at dawn on the 16th along with the rest of the handful of prisoners taken in the coup attempt, held a press conference at 1400 that afternoon in which he implicated the Court and blamed the Imperial Guard for planning the coup. He said that his own views would be found in an editorial in his paper, Bakhtar Emruz, which was also read over Radio Tehran at 1730—it was a long, inflammatory, and savage attack on the Shah and his dead father. Its broadcast and subsequent printing was credited with doing much to stir up the Tudeh-led anti-Shah mobs that raged through Tehran on 17 and 18 August. At the same time, the violence of its tone and language aroused much public sympathy for the Shah. Fatemi Spoke again at 1930 to the crowds massed in Majlis Square, as did a number of pro-Mossadeq Majlis deputies. The Shah was sharply attacked by every speaker; there were insistent demands for his abdication, and the people were told for the first time that he had left the country. Tuesday, the loth, became a day of waiting. the Shah and Queen Soroya flew to Rome from Baghdad that morning; when he arrived at 1500, he made additional statements to the press but did not issue a call to action by the forces supporting him. In Tehran, bands of Tudehites still roamed the streets, and a mob sacked the headquarters of the Pan-Iran Party and small Tudeh and National Front mobs fought each other. The secret police attempted to prevent the publication of opposition newspapers, but a number of them, including Dad and Shahed, were able to get on the streets with replicas of the Shah's firmans. Mosadeq's spokesmen on Radio Tehran announced that a 100,000-rial reward would be paid for information on the whereabouts of General Zahedi and that all demonstrations were banned. General Riahi addressed a meeting of all senior officers of the Tehran garrison at the lecture hall of the Military School and told them in very strong terms that they should remain loyal to the government. Despite the ban on demonstrations, there was continued fighting in the streets on the evening of 18 August Mosadeq's security forces were sent out to clear the streets, and their operations took on a strong anti-Tudeh tone as they beat up demonstrators and forced them to shout pro-Shah slogans. Belatedly realizing what was happening, Tudeh leaders went out into the streets to try to talk the demonstrators into going home, but the excesses of two days of anti-Shah rioting had already done their damage. Early on the morning of the 19th, pro-Shah groups began to gather in the bazaar area in south Tehran, who had been stirred up by Tudeh actions and who were looking for leadership. As the various groups of demonstrators moved northward out of south Tehran, they merged as they reached sepah Square, where they met the troops sent to turn them back. The soldiers fired hundreds of shots over their heads, but whether the order to fire into the crowd was never given or was ignored, they did not shoot into the mob. Sensing that the army was with them, the demonstrators not only began to move faster but took on a festive, holiday atmosphere. it had become a mob wholly different from any seen before in Tehran; it was full of well-dressed, white-collar people, carrying pictures of the Shah and shouting, "Zindebah, Shah!'(Long live the Shah!). Then, the troops began to join in the demonstration. 

  Troops from the Imperial Guard, which had been disbanded ofter its involvement in the 15 August coup attempt, had gathered, and truckloads of soldiers began driving through the streets, shouting and waving pictures of the Shah. Drivers kept their lights on, as they had been asked to do as a sign they supported the Shah. By mid-morning, after the demonstrators had reached Sepah Square and fanned out into the center of the city, General Riahi reported to Mosadeq that he no longer controlled the army, but the Premier told him to hold firm. Mosadeq's house, a prime target of the demonstrators, was being defended by Colonel Momtaz' battalion. Radio Tehran was a key target, since it would not only be able to broadcast the news of the success of the shah's forces in the capital but would also help convince the provinces to join in supporting the Zahedi government. It was important, also, to get it in unsabotaged condition, ready to broadcast. During the morning hours on the 19th it had been broadcasting cotton prices, then switched to recorded music uninterrupted by news bulletins. Shortly before 1430, it suddenly went off the air, apparently as the pro-Shah troops and demonstrators took control of the building in a short, sharp struggle. When it resumed • broadcasting, after a short period of "technical difficulties," all that could be heard was a confused babble of happy voices. Zahedi taken was to Radio Tehran, where he made his speech. In it he promised to restore the rule of law, individual freedom, and freedom of assembly, and he added some popular items such as raising wages, cutting the cost of living, providing free medical treatment, and building more roads. The speech was recorded and broadcast again that night. The troops guarding the residence were unsure of what was happening. When confronted with the large, angry crowd, some of the soldiers opened fire. The fighting escalated as pro-Shah troops returned fire.

  Newspaper accounts of the coup, in particular lennett Love's dispatch to The New York Times which was based on local newspaper accounts, grossly exaggerated the casualties. Love's story said that more than 300 people were killed or wounded, that Mosadeq's house was stormed by Sherman tanks which in turn were battered by shells from loyalist tanks, and that Colonel Momtaz; who led the defenders at the Premier's house, was "torn to pieces" by the mob. "Torn to pieces" was a favourite of Love's; he used it to describe what happened to Foreign Minister Fatemi in his newspaper office. In fact, however, casualties of he coup were relatively light considering the number of people involved; the official toll was 43 dead and 35 wounded, and neither Momtaz nor Fatemi was even scratched, let alone dismembered. Mossadeq, whom the journalists variously described as slipping up a ladder and over his back wall in his pajamas or lying weeping in bed (also in pajamas) when the troops burst in, was not even in his house when it was attacked. He had gone next door and taken temporary refuge with U.S. Point Four chief Willian Warne, who was somewhat embarrassed to have a deposed Premier on his hands, even for a brief period. Over the next few days, Mossadeq and other senior officials of his government turned themselves in or were arrested.

  TPAJAX and the National Interest: the Contemporaneous View:

  Official Washington thought that TPAJAX was a stunning victory for the West. The operation almost certainly prevented Iran from sliding into political anarchy and becoming a target too tempting for the Tudeh and its Soviet mentors to ignore. In the short term, a stable Zahedi Government permitted a rapid settlement of the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute, thereby restarting the flow of oil and providing a much-needed boost for the sagging Iranian economy.  At the time, neither Washington nor London could foresee the long-range benefits that would flow from TPAJAX. The pro-Western, strongly anti-Communist policy of the Zahedi Government that the United States obtained at minimal cost2 would last for 26 years. Secure in the knowledge that the US would support Iran against the USSR, the Shah was able to turn his attention to domestic matters. He began a series of far-reaching modernization efforts, including land reform and steps toward the emancipation of women. TPAJAX came at a time when the events in pre-war Europe were a fresh memory. Americans had seen how Nazi subversion could destroy a country like Czechoslovakia. They had seen the consequences of weakness and appeasement before Nazi and Japanese demands. They had suffered the incalculable cost of failing to act when action might have stopped further aggression. Many were determined never again to let the appearance of weakness and indecision encourage aggression. Neither the White House nor State Department had the slightest doubt that the Soviets coveted Iran and would do whatever they could, short of war, to bring that country within the Soviet orbit. The Azeri crisis of 1947 showed that unless checked, Stalin would continue to test the West's resolve. Stalin's death in March 1953 added a dangerous element of ambiguity to Soviet intentions. Who would succeed the late dictator, the "breaker of nations"?

  Would Soviet policy become more or less aggressive? Would the Soviets reoccupy Iranian Azerbaijan? Would they encourage the Tudeh to topple Mossadeg? The White House, the State Department, and CIA struggled to find answers to these questions. Sending American troops to Iran was never a practical option for logistical and political reasons. An American military occupation almost certainly would have led to war. The USSR would have invoked the terms of the 1921 Treaty of Friendship Between Iran and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic and occupied the northern part of the country. Iran would have been divided into a Communist north and a free south. Fear of partition lay behind Washington's objection to the proposed British occupation of the port city of Abadan early in the oil nationalization crisis. A covert political operation promised to attain American foreign policy and strategic in objectives Iran without the threat of war. CIA gave the Eisenhower administration flexibility where diplomacy had failed and military action was not practical. In addition, CIA gave the US Government "plausible deniability." If a covert action went awry, the President could deny American involvement. With these considerations in mind, and given the widely held Western outlook on the international situation in general and on Soviet intentions in particular, the Eisenhower administration's decision to act in Iran was reasonable and understandable.

  TPAJAX and the National Interest: The Retrospective View:

  A kind of historical hubris results from the belief that because we know far more about the consequences of past acts than contemporaneous actors could know, we are more likely than they are to have a correct interpretation of events and of cause and effect. We cannot know the consequences of decisions not made or actions not taken any more than contemporaries did. Nevertheless, time and knowledge of past events provide the historian with a perspective not available to contemporaries. Some historians argue today that TPAJAX was not in the US national interest. Maintaining that American policymakers in the 1950s defined national security narrowly, these historians emphasize that actions intended to enhance American power ultimately have the opposite effect if they violate democratic ideals. In this view, intervening in domestic political processes in foreign countries inevitably undermines US national security by weakening the values on which US security rests in the long run. Specifically, critics of TPAJAX contend that it damaged American national interests for a number of reasons. In their view, it returned the Shah to his throne illegally. The operation removed a popular, legitimately elected Prime Minister from office (who some now claim would have fallen eventually even without American intervention). Finally, American action created a reservoir of resentment among the Iranian people that helped create the conditions for Ayatollah Khomcini's Islamic Revolution in 1978-79.5 In short, what appeared to be a short-term success ultimately proved to be a failure. This critique deserves careful attention; its more thoughtful and articulate proponents appear to make a persuasive case. The Shah did leave Tehran, to return only when he was certain Mossadeq was gone and American support for the Peacock Throne assured. Mossadeq was popular among some segments of the population. Some Iranians were disillusioned with the United States. They had hoped that the US, as the great postwar anti-colonial power, would not intrigue against their country as the British and Russians had done. A close examination of the facts, however, reveals flaws in the revisionist critique.

  Did the CIA act against a legitimate leader enjoying popular support? Although there is no doubt that Mossadeq captured the imagination of segments of Iranian society with the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951, his political support dwindled steadily. By August 1953 he did not command mass support. The Tudeh and splinters of the National Front were the only political parties willing to support him. The pro-Shah sentiments of the Tehran crowds on 19 August 1953 were genuine. Although CIA had a hand in starting the demonstrations, they swelled spontaneously and took on a life of their own that surprised even Kermit Roosevelt. By August 1953, Mossadeq's support was vociferous but increasingly narrow. The Shah's support was latent but deep, and took a crisis—like the news of Tudeh demonstrators pulling down the Shah's statutes—to awaken. Khorramabad residents, for example, wildly rejoiced at hearing of the monarch's return. Before dismissing reports like those from Khorramabad as propaganda, it must be remembered that CIA was able to influence directly events only in the capital city, and there only barely. Kermit Roosevelt had neither the money nor the agents to initiate the kinds of demonstrations that took place in Iran's widely separated cities.

  Did CIA restore the Shah to his throne? TPAJAX did not "restore" the Shah to his throne either technically or constitutionally. Although the Iranian monarch left Tehran during the operation, he never abdicated. Mossadeq's argument that the Shah's firmans were invalid was disingenuous. The Iranian constitution gave the Shah the right to dismiss the Prime Minister. As soon as Mossadeq refused to obey the Shah's legal order, he was rebelling against constitutional authority. From that point on, TPAJAX became an operation to remove the usurper Mossadeq and permit Zahedi, the legitimate Prime Minister, to take office. Unlike Mossadeq's government, Zahedi's government recognized the Shah's constitutional authority.

  Was TPAJAX Responsible for Khomeini's Islamic Revolution? Revisionists contend that CIA stifled Iran's drive to democracy and strengthened the rule of the autocratic Shah, thereby making Khomeini's revolution all but inevitable. Despite its faults, in this view, Mossadeq's Government represented the popular will. His government reflected a vision for Iran's future that the Shah did not share. Mohammed Reza Pahlavi wanted to transform Iran into a modern Westernized state; his people preferred a more traditional society. In removing Mossadeq, the revisionists continue, the United States and Britain effectively strangled traditional Iranian nationalism. Frustrated and resentful, the people rose 25 years later in rage against the Shah and the United States, disparaged as the "Great Satan." For there can be no doubt that despite years of official American and British denials, most Iranians have been convinced of the CIA's role in Mossadeq's fall. A problem with this thesis is that Mossadeq's Iran was not moving toward democracy. The Prime Minister's increasing political isolation and the fragmentation of the National Front, as documented above, had weakened his position and made him desperate. His dictatorial grab for power from the Majlis alienated his former allies and gained him new political enemies. Iran was, to repeat Iran specialist Kuross Samii's apt metaphor, "an old ship swept away by a storm with no one on board capable of dealing with the attendant frenzy." In fact, Khomeini's revolution was a reaction against secularism, modernization, and the Shah's misrule, not a push for a return to the National Front. The streets of Tehran rang with shouts of fanatical support for Khomeini rather than nostalgic calls for Mossadeq. The Ayatollah was not interested in Mossadeq or the things he stood for. The last thing Khomeini wanted was a secular government with multi-party participation. He would have called for fundamentalist revolution against any government, including a National Front or Tudeh Government, that promoted modernization, the emancipation of women, and secularization.

  Edward Shirley, the former CIA DO employee who journeyed through revolutionary Iran, argues that the revisionist thesis also underestimates the role the clerics played in TPAJAX. Without the support of Ayatollahs Kashani and Behbehani, Shirley doubts the covert political action could have succeeded. What the ayatollahs did in 1953 with American and British help, they might have been able to do later without such help. Alternatively, given Mossadeq's growing political weakness and isolation from Iranian society, the clerics may have defeated him and the National Front in general elections. In short, according to Shirley, the 1953 aborted-democracy theory is appealing, but is "too convenient in its diabolization of the CIA and MI6, and too Persian in its determination to make someone else responsible for failure." Again, "CIA no longer viewed TPAJAX as a military coup—it was now a political action designed to swing the Iranian military away from the illegal Mossadeq government and place the armed forces squarely and actively behind the Shah and the legal Zahedi government"<sup>[[1]](https://ia600106.us.archive.org/12/items/Zendebad-Shah-Iran-Coup-1953/Zendebad-Shah.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://ia601204.us.archive.org/14/items/TheBattleForIran/The%20Battle%20for%20Iran.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Scholars have come to the conclusion that the US had no direct role in the 1949 Syrian coup, if any at all. Historian Andrew Rathmell's landmark study finds, "Recently released US archival material has enabled scholars to look again at Copeland's claims and given them a better opportunity to assess his evidence. A survey of this material, combined with a detailed look at the circumstances surrounding the coup, leads to the conclusion that the CIA had at best a peripheral role in Za'im's coup. There have been few, if any, accusations of covert action by any of the Arab states in backing Za'im's coup. All conspiracy theories have centred on one of the Great Powers. Britain has been accused of backing the coup but there is no evidence to support this line. Reports from the British military attaché and British diplomats in Damascus indicate that they were caught completely by surprise by the move. A degree of French backing is more likely but the lack of French archival material for this period makes it impossible to evaluate these claims. It is to Washington and Langley that the most popular conspiracy theories surrounding this coup lead. Since much of the US material remains classified, a definitive account of the American role cannot yet be given. None the less, it is worth reconsidering the evidence as it is far from conclusive. From the available evidence, it appears that US officials had foreknowledge of Za'im's plans. There is, however, no good evidence of a coup having been plotted in Washington." The author continues, "from the evidence available, it appears that the US's role was far more limited than has been portrayed in the past. The State Department had little reason to be enthusiastic about the coup. Copeland and Meade, as far as one can tell, did no more than discuss Za'im's plans with him shortly before he moved. Even the minimal encouragement they may have offered was not necessarily authorized by the CIA, given Copeland's tendency to report 'out of the chain of command. Unless further evidence comes to light, the notion of Husni Za'im as having been put in place by Copeland and his cronies must be assigned to the class of conspiracy theories which contain more fiction than fact."<sup>[[1]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1949v06/d1137)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684529608432345?journalCode=fint20)</sup></sup>

However, several declassified documents confirm "that the US will not support any extraconstitutional moves to oust Chavez" and that these warnings "probably have given pause to the plotters."<sup>[[2]](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2007-044-doc1.pdf)</sup></sup> An independent State Department Inspector General reviewed these allegations, and found 0 basis for the charge.

- Between 1946-2000, contrary to many pundits, conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists claims—the US Army's School of Americas taught Caribbean, Central and South American countries on sound and relevant military doctrine; promoted democratic values; a respect for civilian government control, and respect for human rights among multinational forces. Every student receives the following human rights training: definition of concepts; the historical development of conventions and declarations; civilian control of the armed forces; the role of those forces in a democracy; and the military advantage for complying with human rights and the Law of Armed Conflict. As part of its internal evaluation process, the SOA requires all students to discuss the effects of human rights instruction in their course critiques. Students are required to describe how SOA instruction in human rights, democratization, civil control of the military, and military justice affected them and how the instruction may have changed any previously held views." All students are screened for criminal and human rights abuses. Countries with poor respect for human rights were prohibited from sending people to SOA.
 
  Several reviews conducted in the 1990s confirm the commendable effort of SOA: A Government Accountability Office report finds SOA training, "is intended to provide a long-term investment in a positive relationship with Latin America. The SOA courses emphasize the protection of human rights." A Board of Visitors report in 1996 found "SOA fulfils a need in providing instruction on civilian control, democratic values and human rights." A TRADOC Task Force report in 1994 finds, "the nomination & selection process of SOA cadre and students is sound. Less than 1 percent of all SOA graduates are alleged to have committed crimes or human rights violations. There is no evidence that indicates that the SOA courses influenced alleged behavior. The SOA program for human rights training is the most comprehensive and well-developed program in the US Army." It goes on, "However, there are cases where a heightened awareness and further scrutiny are needed. These cases occur most often in connection with specific information developed by the Embassy and reported to Washington. Examples include the troubled human rights record of security forces in Indonesia, colombia, and Turkey. In such cases, our assistance to the police and military is carefully vetted with the appropriate bureaus in the State Department to ensure that no training or materiel is provided to units where there is credible evidence they have been involved in the commission of gross violations of human rights. On a few occasions, evidence of gross human rights violations has required a complete reappraisal of U.S. training activities in a specific country. In Indonesia, for example, DoD cancelled the JCET program in May 1998 and has not resumed the program. Currently, U.S. military training with the Indonesian military is limited to a small program of humanitarian, engineering, and medical activities. In addition, a mobile team will provide training in human rights awareness and civil-military relations. There is no training by the U.S military for the Indonesian military in lethal military skills, nor is any contemplated. In the case of Colombia, approval for training activities involves a two-phased screening process by our Embassy's country team. All individuals or units selected to receive training are carefully vetted by the Embassy for criminal, human rights, or narcotics violations. This applies whether the planned training is in-country or in the U.S. Additionally, through a 1997 End-Use Monitoring agreement with the Government of Colombia, indigenous sources of information (e.g., criminal records) are reviewed and then double-checked against U.S. Government records before training is approved. In fact several training activities have recently been cancelled or delayed due to the rigorous screening process at our Embassy."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/soareport)</sup></sup>
  
  As for the Spanish-language training manuals: A 1992 investigation found that a few, short passages (out of 1169 pages in total) in the manuals used between 1987 to 1991 didn't meet DoD standards, should be destroyed. It found that there was no deliberate or orchestrated attempt to violate DoD policy, domestic or international law. The "questionable" passages are nothing that serious either, even while out of context. The review found, "seven spanish-language training manuals had been compiled from outdated instructional material without the required doctrinal reviews or approval. They had evolved from lesson plans used in an intelligence course at USASOA. The officers assumed that the information in the lesson plans. reflected current and authoritative doctrine and, therefore, sought no additional approval either from USSOUTHCOM or the Army. They were based, in part, on old material dating back to the 1960's from the Army's Foreign Intelligence Assistance Program, entitled "Project X." This material had been retained in the files of the Army Intelligence School at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. we found that neither the Army element at USSOUTHCOM nor the faculty at USASOA followed the Army policy for the doctrinal approval of the manuals. This process requires that all intelligence instructional material be developed or reviewed by "Subject Matter Experts" at the Army Intelligence School. To compound the problem, no English-language versions of the manuals were ever prepared."<sup>[[2]](https://ia600400.us.archive.org/34/items/soareport/SOAPhase2.pdf)</sup></sup> A follow-up, 1997 IG report independently corroborates these findings.<sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/soa-ig-phase-1/mode/2up)</sup></sup> Sadly, despite all of this, allegations by conspiracy theorists and sensational headlines—like with ACORN in 2010, proved devastating. Congress closed the school in 2000.

- In Peru, between 1995 and 2001, the CIA worked with the Peruvian Government in a counternarcotics operation. In 2001, the Peruvian Air Force accidentally shot down a US plane carrying missionaries. Shortly after the incident, Director Hayden tasked the CIA's Inspector General reviewed the matter: Finding a lapse in procedures and charged that some CIA officers involved attempted to cover it up. This was disputed by a another seperate, independent Agency Accountability Board review, that examined both the IG's report as well as conducting its own investigation. 16 officers were administratively punished after the Board's report was sent to Director Panetta. DOJ concurred with this finding, declining to criminally charge anyone involved. The fault lied mostly with the Peruvian Air Force in failing to adhere to the procedures as they had done so in the past.<sup>[[1]](https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/cia-statement-2001-peru-shootdown/story?id=9738624)</sup></sup>

- In 1996, an independent review panel examined all US Government involvement with Guatemala. On CIA's interaction with Guatemalan security services between 1980 and 1996—It also examined the DoD and other US agencies in their relation to counterparts in Guatemala. It finds, "The CIA endeavoured to improve this behavior of the Guatemalan services through frequent and close contact and by stressing the importance of human rights—insisting, for example, that Guatemalan military intelligence training include human rights instruction. The station officers assigned to Guatemala and the CIA headquarters officials whom we interviewed believe that the CIA's contact with the Guatemalan services helped improve attitudes towards human rights. The CIA's Directorate of Operations (DO) and Guatemala station were clearly aware of the potential for human rights violations by assets and liaison contacts. In November 1988, the DO's Latin America (LA) division provided a guidance cable to its Central American stations: "Point we would like to make is that we must all become sensitized to the importance of respecting human rights, and we must ensure that those assets and resource we direct and/or fund are equally sensitive. The issue will only become more important, and we serve our objectives best if we remember that if we ignore the importance of the human rights issue in the final analysis we do a great damage to our mission. We are under great scrutiny. Finally, aside from the legal and policy considerations which are constant in any allegations concerning violations of human rights we also recognize a basic moral obligation. We are Americans and we must reflect American values in the conduct of our business. We are all inherently opposed to the violation of human rights. Those who work with us in one capacity or another must also respect these values.

  Apart from the guidance to Guatemala station and other Latin American stations that is described above, there was no CIA-wide policy before 1995 that spelled out in detail the the danger of human rights abuses by assets and what specific actions were to be taken by the stations and at CIA Headquarters in such circumstances." It continues, "US policy objectives in Guatemala from 1984 to the present--the period we reviewed--included supporting the transition to and strengthening of civilian democratic government, furthering human rights and the rule of law, supporting economic growth, combating illegal narcotics trafficking, combating the communist insurgency, and advancing the current peace process between the government and the guerrillas...The CIA's successes in Guatemala in conjunction with other US agencies, particularly in uncovering and working to counter coups and in reducing the narcotics flow, were at times dramatic and very much in the national interests of both the United States and Guatemala."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/report-on-the-guatemala-review)</sup></sup>
   
  An Inspector General's multi-volume series on Guatemala concludes similar, which was corroborated by the panel's report.<sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/guatemala-igreports)</sup></sup> The Department of Defense also issued its 1995 Guatemala review. It found that US DoD Policy towards Guatemala was: "Promoting a stable democratic government to include ending the Marxist insurgency; eliminating human rights abuses; responding to the economic and social needs of the Guatemalan people; and reducing drugs and drug trafficking. Based on the documentation reviewed, all significant DoD programs and activities in Guatemala from 1980 to 1995 were within the stated US Policy objectives: There were 1,366 deployments to Guatemala during the period. Involving at least 25,021 DoD personnel. US military personnel performed humanitarian and civic action exercises designed to demonstrate the role of the military in stabilizing a democratic government and improving the economic and social welfare of the Guatemalan people. Since 1990, DoD personnel have supported the Drug Enforcement Administration's effort to interdict narcotics trafficking in Guatemala by transporting law enforcement personnel, detecting suspected trafficking activity, providing intelligence support and assisting in planning counterdrug operations. The DoD security assistance program during the period totalled 28 million in grant aid and 3.384 million in International Military Education and Training. With the exception of one UH-1 helicopter in 1983, no major end items were provided to the Government of Guatemala."<sup>[[3]](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Sep/11/2001806396/-1/-1/1/REPORT%20TO%20THE%20SECRETARY%20OF%20DEFENSE%20ON%20DOD%20ACTIVITIES%20IN%20GUATEMALA%20(U).PDF)</sup></sup>
  
  A 1986 GAO report examined US arms supply relationship with Guatemala, it finds that, "direct U.S. military assistance was discontinued between fiscal years 1978 and 1984, and commercial sales dropped significantly in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s because of cited human rights violations. Reagan administration officials and documents stated that their arms transfer policy as it concerns human rights conditions is geared toward rewarding improvement rather than trying to coerce improvement by withholding military assistance, which was the Carter administration’s approach."<sup>[[4]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-86-31.pdf)</sup></sup>

A landmark study found, "In contrast, the documentary record indicates that while Kissinger was occasionally informed of what was transpiring in Costa Rica, he was largely disengaged from the handling of the relationship. Nor is there any evidence of US involvement in coup plotting in Costa Rica. To the contrary, rather than humiliate Figueres, the United States restricted its major attempts to influence the Costa Rican president to private discussions."<sup>[[1]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14682745.2019.1673372)</sup></sup>

## Iran/Contra
   A lot of myths and conspiracy theories surround this topic. Often, people lump together: The "Iran/Contra affair" (also known as the Iran-Contra matter,) with the crack allegations, with the support to the democratic resistance movement, the Contras. In this subsection, I will address each in order: Context to support the Contras and the efforts to do so, then the affair itself, lastly ending with the drug allegations. This will provide a seamless factual narrative.
   
#### Contra support:

- 1979-1987, Nicaragua/Contras. Years of KGB propaganda have tainted the historical record of the US support to the Contras: Their propaganda was just a projection of Nicaraguan atrocities, such as support to terrorists in surrounding democratic countries—which was on a far larger scale and with greater disregard for human rights—compared to US support to freedom fighters. The primary objective of the Contra program was to persuade Nicaragua to abandon its efforts to engineer the overthrow of neighbouring democratic governments by armed force. The broader US policy and objectives towards Nicaragua were: Holding the implementation of Sandinista commitment to the organization of American States to political pluralism, human rights, free elections, non-alignment, and a mixed economy.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/secret-war-in-central-america-and-the-future-of-world-order/0E5915FA4FCD3CAE1328774CF7A540DA)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/nicaraguavunited0000turn/mode/2up)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/8066report)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/whnicaragua-settlement)</sup></sup> It was not to overthrow the brutal regime, which was committing numerous atrocities and human rights abuses.<sup>[[5]](https://archive.org/details/nicaraguas-military-build-up-and-support-for-central-american-subversion/mode/2up)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://archive.org/details/inside-the-sandinista-regime-a-special-investigators-perspective)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://archive.org/details/sandinista-prisons-a-tool-of-intimidation)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://archive.org/details/nicaragua-stolen-revolution-1983)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://archive.org/details/crackdown-on-freedom-in-nicaragua)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754050096308&view=1up&seq=3)</sup></sup> <sup>[[11]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31210024350561&view=1up&seq=1https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31210024350561&view=1up&seq=1)</sup></sup> <sup>[[12]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86M00886R001500010003-5.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Corruption started to seep into the Somoza Government during the mid-70s, which led to wide-spread protests and opposition. With the assassination of Somoza's critic, Pedro, this only intensified the opposition, leading even to non-Marxist resistance groups joining with the FSLN, leading to the creation of a Broad Opposition Front. The Front sought to draw people from all economic classes, ages and professions into the anti-Somoza opposition. At this time, the US, in coordination with the Organization of American States (OAS), pressured Somoza to step down, and peacefully transition Government by democratic election. The US provided several options, however Somoza refused them all. In response, the US cut economic and military aid, and pressured other Governments to do the same—thus resulting in his flee from the country. At this time, the Sandinista forces, a small militant minority moved into Managua and assumed power. The leaders of the FSLN had publicly pledged themselves to the principles of political pluralism, a mixed economy, and a non-aligned foreign policy. Since these pledges were thought to reflect the official position of the new Government of National Reconstruction (GRN), it enjoyed broad international support, and the United States took the lead in the assistance effort, providing $118 million of economic aid and humanitarian assistance during the following 18 months. This was more than any other country provided the new regime, and represented more aid than the United States had provided Somoza in the previous four years. European and Latin American countries, notably Venezuela, also rushed aid to impoverished and war-wracked Nicaragua. The aid, provided by PL 96-257, contained a provision, however, that the US would cease economic aid if it the Sandinistas engaged in suppression of human rights, free press, etc. Despite promising free elections, free enterprise, an independent judiciary, and an end to political oppression, the Sandinistas seized television and radio stations, censored La Prensa, and established a Cuban-modeled internal security apparatus. In 1980, the Sandinista Government announced that it would not hold national elections until 1985. This convinced many Nicaraguans that the prospects for a true democracy were growing dimmer under FSLN dominance. In published statements, Sandinista officials expressed their desire for better relations with the United States and insisted that they had no intention of supporting insurgencies aimed at subverting their neighbors. Their actions, however, began to raise additional doubts. Weapons and equipment sent by Cuba through Nicaragua began making their way to rebels in El Salvador. The Sandinista next led the way in militarizing Central America—leading to instability and a rein of terror across the region, all bankrolled by Russia.<sup>[[13]](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/public/digitallibrary/smof/publicliaison/beserra/oa19286/40-044-12006223-OA19286-001-2019.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[14]](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1977-1980/central-america-carter)</sup></sup> <sup>[[15]](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-94/pdf/STATUTE-94-Pg422.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[16]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c070986841&view=1up&seq=626&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[17]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/secret-war-in-central-america-and-the-future-of-world-order/0E5915FA4FCD3CAE1328774CF7A540DA)</sup></sup>
  
  In response to pleas from countries victim to the regime, in 1981, DCI William Casey created the Central America Task Force (CATF) at CIA. A Presidential Finding, signed by President Reagan in December 1981, authorized Agency covert and paramilitary operations, facilitated through friendly governments, against Cuban and Sandinista targets involved in arms trafficking to insurgents in Central America. To ensure CIA's program did not go beyond arms interdiction, Congress enacted an Intelligence Authorization Act in December 1982 that prohibited CIA from supplying money, arms, training, or support to any individual or organization seeking to overthrow the GRN or involved in provoking military confrontations between Nicaragua and Honduras. In September 1983, the Agency was given greater latitude in its relationship with the Contra forces by a new Presidential Finding that changed the objective of Contra support from interdicting arms trafficking to bringing the Sandinistas into peace negotiations. Legislation was enacted in October 1984 that precluded the Agency from providing paramilitary assistance to the Contra forces over the next two years. During this period, the combat effectiveness of the Contra forces declined. NSC staff who were not covered by this legislation, encouraged other states to support the democratic resistance. In October 1986, after considerable debate in Congress, the Agency was authorized to provide paramilitary support to the resistance forces and $100 million was allocated to this purpose for Fiscal Year 1987, beginning in October 1986. The legislation that authorized this assistance contained a provision that barred aid to any group whose members were found to have engaged in "gross violations of internationally recognized human rights... or drug smuggling, or significant misuse of public or private funds.

  Only two Agency field managers engaged in improper activities between September 1985 and February 1987 in connection with assistance to the Contras. The improper activities included assistance in connection with a private benefactor resupply flights, transporting Contra supplied and equipment in Agency helicopters, and other logistical assistance undertaken at a time when such assistance was prohibited by Agency policy or legal guidance. One Agency field manager autorized his subordinates to engage in these improper activities. The other field manager undertook the activities on his own. There is no evidence in the record, however, that any improper activities were engaged in by the overwhelming majority of Agency employees involved in the Contra program. Moreover, HQS had no knowledge that these activities were taking place. Despite the complexities caused by seven different pieces of legislation dealing with Contra assistance during a five year period, HQS guidance with respect to these statutory restrictions generally was clear and often more conservative than required by the applicable statutes. These two men were fired.<sup>[[18]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP95M00249R000801130011-7.pdf)</sup></sup> No one was convicted for Boland amendment violations.<sup>[[19]](https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/walsh/summpros.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[[20]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112071984519&view=2up&seq=40&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[21]](https://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair/documents/d-all-19.pdf)</sup></sup> 
  
  Sham elections. Some pundits claim that the Sandinistas winning the elections in 1984 legitimised their rule, that is reflected popular support. However, this is both irrelevant, and incorrect. It's irrelevant because the covert program did not, at any time, have the goal to overthrow the regime. Further, the regime promised to hold elections within two years of coming to power—they did not—the covert program stopped in October 1984, and did not resume until October 1986. It is thus impossible to say the US engaged in any effort to overthrow a government, even if it were popular and legitimate. Lastly, the elections themselves were neither free nor fair. The Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), which led the military struggle, promised to the people and to the international community that it would promote a pluralistic system in which all sectors of the society could participate freely. Once in power, however, the Sandinistas quickly lost interest in elections, insisting that they were "the vanguard of the people" with a historic right to rule. The Sandinistas concluded that they could use elections as a mechanism to affirm the international legitimacy of the revolution. They anticipated that by persuading the world that their revolution was democratic and popular, they could obtain increased levels of economic aid from the West and intensify political pressure on those who supported groups opposed to the FSLN. However, the Sandinistas ensured that the electoral process could not result in a transfer of power. Acting under a State of Emergency which imposed strict censorship and stifled the activities of other parties, the FSLN enacted laws which guaranteed its control over every aspect of the electoral process. The Sandinistas scheduled elections for November 4, 1984. Seven parties have registered to run the FSLN itself; three other Marxist parties; two parties of the democratic left, one of which is allied with the FSLN; and a faction of the conservative party which has benefited from FSLN assistance. The FSLN has exploited its control of the government (including the police and military), of the media, and of mass organisations to promote its own campaign while obstructing those of the other parties. The largest of the three registered non-Marxist parties withdrew from the elections in protest on October 21, and the others took the same action.

  The mainline democratic opposition parties, allied in the Democratic Coordinating Board (Coordinadora), have refused to register under conditions that they believe do not permit a free and fair election. They repeatedly have called upon the Sandinistas to give the necessary guarantees so that they could compete, but the Sandinistas have rejected their proposals and have refused to negotiate seriously. Instead, Sandinista turbas (mobs) have repeatedly disrupted meetings of the Democratic Coordinating Board, frequently using violence. In calling for an election, however, the comandantes made clear that the process could not result in a transfer of power. Defense Minister Humberto Ortega stressed that the elections would serve only to strengthen the FSLN, and that power would not be " raffled off " as in some lottery. Planning Minister Henry Ruiz, also a member of the FSLN's National Directorate,  reiterated that the purpose of the election was to confirm the leadership of the FSLN, and he explained that the people had a right to pluralism, but with Sandinista hegemony. Junta Coordinator Daniel Ortega Saavedra, also a member of the FSLN's National Directorate, vowed that "neither bullets nor ballots" would ever push the FSLN from power. The elections of 5 November 1984 were held in an atmosphere of political and psychological intimidation. Food was used as a political weapon by the Sandinistas. Because access to government food stores rested with the local Sandinista Defense Committee (CDS), it was widely perceived that not voting would mean not eating. The CDSs played an important role in the period leading up to the election. In the May 1984 secret speech noted earlier, Bayardo Arce said: "We see the elections as one more weapon of the revolution to bring its historical objectives gradually into reality. Therefore, we intend to take advantage of them."<sup>[[22]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015014217833&view=2up&seq=6)</sup></sup> <sup>[[23]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c070986841&view=1up&seq=626&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[24]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.319510029220985&view=2up&seq=2)</sup></sup> <sup>[[25]](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/public/digitallibrary/smof/publicliaison/beserra/oa19286/40-044-12006223-OA19286-001-2019.pdf)</sup> <sup>[[26]](https://ia902601.us.archive.org/20/items/8066report/8066report.pdf#page=7)</sup></sup> 

  As for the legality on this matter, to quote at length from the ICJ dissenting opinion It's worth noting the dissenting opinion is more than twice as long as the judgement, and revisits the factual and legal record before it, applying far more care. Many in-depth studies have pointed out the severe flaws of the ICJ ruling in its treatment of evidence.<sup>[[27]](https://archive.org/details/nicaraguavunited0000turn/mode/2up)</sup></sup>
  "I am profoundly pained to say, I dissent from this judgement because i believe that, in effect, it adopts the false testimony of representatives of the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua on a matter which, in my view, is material to its disposition...The facts are in fundamental controversy. I find the Court's statement of the facts to be inadequate, in that it is sufficiently sets out the facts which have led it to reach conclusions of law adverse to the United States, while insufficiently sets out the facts which should have led it to reach conclusions of law adverse to Nicaragua. 

  Without any pretence, still less actuality, of provocation, Nicaragua since 1979 has assisted and persisted in efforts to overthrow the Government of El Salvador by providing large-scale, significant and sustained assistance to the rebellion in El Salvador - a rebellion which, before the rendering of Nicaraguan assistance, was ill-organised, ill-equipped and ineffective. The delictual acts of the Nicaraguan Government have not been confined to provision of very large quantities of arms, munitions and supplies; Nicaragua (and Cuba) have joined with the Salvadoran rebels in the organisation, planning and training for their acts of insurgency; and Nicaragua has provided the Salvadoran insurgents with command-and-control facilities, bases, communications and sanctuary, which have enabled the leadership of the Salvadoran insurgency to operate from Nicaraguan territory. Under both customary and conventional international law, that scale of Nicaraguan subserve activity not only constitutes unlawful intervention in the affairs of El Salvador; it is cumulatively tantamount to an armed attack upon El Salvador."
  
  "Not only is El Salvador entitled to defend itself against this armed attack; it can, and has, called upon the United States to assist it in the exercise of collective self-defense. The United States is legally entitled to respond. It can lawfully respond to Nicaragua's covert attempt to overthrow the Government of El Salvador by overt or covert pressures, military and other, upon the Government of Nicaragua, which are exerted either directly upon the Government, territory and people of Nicaragua by the United States, or indirectly through the actions of Nicaraguan rebels - the "contras" - supported by the United States."<sup>[[28]](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/70/070-19860627-JUD-01-09-EN.pdf)</sup></sup> 

  On Contra's alleged atrocities: Contrary to historical revisionists claims, the Contras never condoned nor sanctioned human rights abuses or atrocities, as the Sandinista regime did. However, yes, there were a few atrocities committed by members of the Contras. Upon thorough investigation, and judicial finding, several were executed, exiled, or other such punishments. Many reports from HRW, Brody, Americas Watch, etc. Have been thoroughly investigated, and found to be severely lacking in credibility. Though, few cases were verified. Often, these organisations were merely regurgitate Sandinista disinformation, that was already debunked at the time.<sup>[[29]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85T01058R000100170001-7.pdf)</sup></sup> Another examination revealed, "The resistance human rights program has the support of the top resistance leadership and includes training for commanders and troops. Troops in training receive instruction on the law of war and receive two pamphlets on acceptable human rights practices to carry on them. UNO/FDN is training human rights officers for each regional command and task force. A portion of the 27 million in humanitarian assistance approved by Congress has been used to fund the UNO human rights program. To reinforce this effort, 3 million is to be available to strengthen programs and activities of the Nicaraguan democratic resistance for the observance and advancement of human rights."<sup>[[30]](https://archive.org/details/contra-misconduct-report)</sup></sup>

  A report prepared by the Director of the UNO Commission of Human Rights reviews twenty-one cases in which members were accused under the "Code of Conduct" of crimes ranging from theft to homicide and lists punishments accorded those found guilty. Of the 21 persons whose court-martials are addressed in the report, 19 were convicted and two found innocent. The two murder cases were a case of accidental shooting and a "crime of passion" involving only members of the FDN. In one of the cases, the defendant had stolen a horse and a pistol from a Nicaraguan civilian. Because of his mistreatment of a civilian, the normal two-year sentence was doubled. 19 UNO/FDN combatants are reported currently held in detention facilities at resistance camps, serving sentences imposed in accordance with the "Code of Conduct." Resistance members have also been expelled from the movement for criminal actions which may have involved human rights abuses. The punitive measures taken against human rights offenders and the efforts underway to improve the resistance record clearly indicate that the resistance leadership does not condone human rights violations and has taken positive action to prevent their occurrence.<sup>[[31]](https://ia600204.us.archive.org/8/items/whnicaragua-settlement/WHNicaraguaSettlement.pdf#page=18)</sup></sup>

  As for the "guerilla manual," it is largely exaggerated by pundits.<sup>[[32]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90B01370R001501940012-9.pdf)</sup></sup> The CIA learned of a draft manual created by non-Americans in late Spring, 1983. CIA found the manual to be totally unacceptable, because it called for widespread use of indiscriminate violence. US personnel urged the draft manual never be used, and all copies of it destroyed. This, however, prompted CIA to make a code of conduct and training material, together known as the blue book and white book, to assure FDN fighters going into villages, how to deal with locals, in a manner consistent with FDN's democratic objectives—The code of conduct book, known as the blue book. Every FDN soldier carried one. It explains that the objective of the FDN is the development of a democratic and pluralistic government in Nicaragua, to establish social justice and human rights, to restore the freedoms violated by the Sandinistas, and to achieve economic reform and greater social mobility.<sup>[[33]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86M00886R001300010022-6.pdf)</sup></sup> At FDN request, a manual was created for Psychological operations, as guidance. Context is critical. It notes that every combatant is highly motivated to engage in propaganda. It explains how they can counter, and win hearts and minds, such as, avoid violence as much as possible.<sup>[[34]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170215021829/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86B00269R001500230003-7.pdf)</sup></sup> A plain reading of the manual, as Sen. Malcolm Wallop put it, "taken as a whole, the manual calls for the avoidance of violence to the extent possible and was designed to put restraint and a rationale on guerrilla operations as a whole, the manual is a code of conduct for which the United States ought not to be ashamed." After press reporting, two investigations followed: One by CIA's Independent Inspector General; one by the President's Intelligence Oversight Board. All concluded the purpose of the manual was to moderate freedom fighters in their struggle against a brutal regime, and how to win support of the people. However, due to poor translation by the contractor who made the document, a few words were misinterpreted, such as "neutralized".<sup>[[35]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90B01370R001501940018-3.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[36]](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/statement-principal-deputy-press-secretary-speakes-central-intelligence-agency)</sup></sup> 

#### Iran/Contra affair:

- The United States was taken by surprise when the Shah fell in 1979, because it had not developed an adequate human intelligence capability in Iran. Our hearings have established that little had been done to remedy the situation by the mid-1980's. The United States was still without adequate intelligence when, in 1985, it was approached by Israel with a proposal that the United States acquiesce in Israeli sales of U.S.-origin arms to Iran.  Long term strategic considerations dictated that the United States try to improve relations with at least some of the important factions in Iran. The lack of adequate intelligence about the situation inside Iran made it imperative to pursue any potentially fruitful opportunity; it also made those pursuits inherently risky. United States decisions of necessity had to be based on the thinnest of independently verifiable information. Lacking such independent intelligence, the United States was forced to rely on sources known to be biased and unreliable. Well aware of the risk, the Administration nonetheless decided that the opportunity was worth pursuing. The major participants in the Iran arms affair obviously had some common and some conflicting interests. The key question the United States had to explore was whether the U.S. and Iranian leadership actually felt enough of a common interest to establish a strategic dialogue. No one can deny the common U.S. and Iranian interest in opposing Soviet expansion. But how much would that community of interest be felt, acknowledged and acted upon? Iran and the United States have compatible goals in Afghanistan. The question was whether such isolated examples could be broadened into something more substantial.

  The initial dealings with the Iranian government were undermined by the unreliability of the intermediary, Manucher Ghorbanifar. Nevertheless, Ghorbanifar did help obtain the release of two U.S. hostages (Rev. Benjamin Weir and Father Lawrence Jenco) and he did also produce high Iranian officials for the first face to face meetings between our governments in five years. At those meetings, U.S. officials sought consistently to make clear that we were interested in a long-term strategic relationship with Iran to oppose Soviet expansionism. The hostages issue was presented as an obstacle to an enhanced relationship that would have to be overcome, not as the objective of the initiative. Colonel North made an extensive presentation to this effect in February 1986; former National Security Adviser McFarlane made a similar presentation in Tehran in May 1986. But the Iranian officials brought by Ghorbanifar seemed to be interested only in weapons, and in using the hostages for bargaining leverage. The full extent of the difference between these approaches finally was made obvious to the United States at the meeting in Tehran, which North, McFarlane and others attended at great personal risk. Ghorbanifar appears to have misled both sides in the preparations for that meeting. Afterwards, the United States suspended discussions arranged by Ghorbanifar, except to complete the transactions already underway.

  After the Tehran meetings, the United States was able to approach a very high-ranking Iranian official using a second channel arranged by Albert Hakim and his associates. Clearly, Hakim had business motives in arranging these contacts. Whatever his motives, he did produce contacts at the highest levels of the Iranian government. Discussions with this channel began in the middle of 1986 and continued until December. They resulted in the release of one further hostage (David Jacobsen), and U.S. officials expected them to result in the release of more hostages. Perhaps more importantly, these discussions appear to have considered the possibility of broad areas of strategic cooperation. However, as a result of factional infighting inside the Iranian government, the initiative was exposed and substantive discussions were suspended. Not surprisingly, given the nature of Iranian politics, the Iranian government has publicly denied that significant negotiations had taken place. In retrospect, it seems clear that this initiative degenerated into a series of "arms for hostage" deals. But it did not look that way to many of the U.S. participants at the time. In our view, it is simply wrong, therefore, to reduce the complex motivations behind these events to any one simple thesis. Clearly, the participants from different countries, and even those within each country, had different, and sometimes conflicting, motives. Without endorsing or agreeing with the use of arms sales as a tactic, we believe that U.S. officials made a risky, but nevertheless worthwhile effort.

  What has come to be called the diversion was simply a transfer of a portion of the proceeds of the Iranian arms sales to the private Contra resupply operation under the direction of Gen. Secord. The funds came from two different sources. The initial diversion appears to have been from Israeli funds. In late 1985, after the sale of HAWK missiles by Israel to Iran, North informed Secord that the Israelis would not ask for the return of the unused transportation expense and that Secord could use it for other purposes. Secord testified that he used it for the Contra project and so informed North. The Iranian intermediary (Ghorbanifar) would deposit funds in an israeli account. The Israelis would transfer these funds to a sterile US-controlled account in an overseas bank. Using these funds, the CIA would purchase the material authorised for transfer from the Army, and transport this to Israel for onward movement to Iran. he first time a possible surplus came to North's attention was after the November 1985 sale of HAWK missiles from Israel to Iran. Secord had been provided with $1 million by the Israelis to cover transportation for the missiles from Israel to Iran. When the Iranians expressed dissatisfaction with the initial delivery, further deliveries were stopped, and Secord had spent only $200,000 of his retainer. Secord testified that the $800,000 surplus was eventually spent on the Contra resupply project. Hence. the initial diversion appears to have occurred with Israeli funds.

  It must be noted that the surplus from the US side came from the Army's price when selling to the CIA, which was the result of 3 errors on part of the Army. An Army Inspector General and House Armed Services Committee investigations learned that this was not a deliberate attempt to generate extra funds. The most reasonable calculations show that approximately $3.8 million of proceeds from the Iran arms transactions was spent for the support of the Nicaraguan Resistance.<sup>[[37]](https://archive.org/details/hasc-iran-contra-report)</sup></sup> <sup>[[38]](https://archive.org/details/army-igiran-hawk)</sup></sup> 

  The diversion was authorized by Poindexter. The Committees were careful when taking testimony on this point to make sure that the principal witnesses would testify in private session before they had a chance to hear the crucial public testimony of this particular point. Thus, Poindexter testified in private session, before North's closed session or public testimony, that he had authorized the diversion at North's request. North corroborated this point in his own executive session testimony before he could have known anything about what Poindexter had said. Poindexter also testified that he believed he had the authority to make the decision on his own to approve the use of the Iranian arms sales surplus for the Nicaraguan Resistance. He said that because he had worked for the President for a number of years, he felt he knew what the President would want to have done in this situation. Poindexter stated that to him, the diversion appeared to involve the use of what could be considered either third-country funds, or private funds, to support the Contras, and that he believed the President favored the use of such private or third-country funds to support them. Therefore, in his view, the President would have agreed to the use of surplus funds in such a manner. However, Poindexter said, because he thought it would be politically (as opposed to legally) controversial to use the funds to support the Contras, he decided not to inform the President of it so the President could truthfully deny knowledge if the diversion were revealed. The President has stated, however, that he would not have consented to the diversion had he known about it. He has also stated that in his opinion, Admiral Poindexter did not have the authority to make the decision without the President's approval.

  The Committees have received no documentary evidence or testimony which shows that any other U.S. Government official approved or in any other way was involved in agreeing to the diversion. Col. North testified that Director Casey knew about, and was supportive of, the diversion, but North did not suggest that Casey's approval was either sought or required. The evidence available to these Committees shows that the President did not know about the diversion. The President has made this point repeatedly. The Committees have received sworn testimony supporting the President on this point from four individuals with first-hand knowledge, and from another individual who directly corroborates some of this key testimony. The plain fact of the matter is that the Committees have no testimony or documentary evidence to the contrary. In all, only 204 TOW missiles, 18 HAWKs, and 200 HAWK battery spare parts were sold.<sup>[[39]](https://archive.org/details/iran-contra-investigation_202401)</sup></sup> <sup>[[40]](https://web.archive.org/web/20220623074901/http://www.hjil.org/articles/hjil-11-1-turner.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[41]](https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1701&context=plr)</sup></sup> <sup>[[42]](https://web.archive.org/web/20220623074904/http://www.hjil.org/articles/hjil-11-1-bruemmer-silverberg.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[43]](https://archive.org/details/us-iran-contacts)</sup></sup> <sup>[[44]](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/public/digitallibrary/smof/counsel/culvahouse/cfoa1132/40-123-12011812-CFOA1132-025-2018.pdf)</sup></sup>

   One should also take pause when reading the Walsh report, and not see it as a definitive accounting of the topic. As a Federal Court overseeing the subject observed, "They charge, accurately, that the Report repeatedly accuses named individuals of crimes, although in many instances the individual was never indicted, if indicted was never convicted, or if convicted the conviction was reversed. These accusations include charges that named individuals were guilty of a conspiracy charged in a count that was dismissed before trial, that various named public officials engaged in efforts to obstruct justice, where such individuals were never indicted, let alone convicted, and instances in which the Report charges that individuals were "factually guilty" even though the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had reversed the only conviction relevant to the charge under discussion. Our review of the Report confirms that the movants' charges are accurate. The Report is rife with accusations of guilt of criminal conduct against persons never indicted or convicted."<sup>[[45]](https://casetext.com/case/in-re-north-35)</sup></sup>

   However, ignoring the substantive failures of the 1993 Walsh report, it's worth noting a far more careful, and thorough analysis of fact and law was written: A lawyer for the Independent Counsel provided a comprehensive evaluation of the legal liability of President Ronald Reagan and Bush's connection to the Iran Contra affair. His report was issued in 1991. Ultimately, facts and law won out, and neither Bush nor Reagan were charged. In examining both, the 1991 review found neither violated any laws. "There is no evidence that President Reagan received any information about this misuse of his Iran Initiative until November 24, 1986, when Attorney General Meese reported it to him as the leading result of Meese's November 21-25 investigation." 

   It continues, "In conclusion, the available evidence does not clearly support—and to some extent refutes—the proposition that President Reagan had detailed familiarity with the role of the NSC staff in providing the Contras with military supplies during 1985 and 1986." Worded another way, the review finds, "The ultimate issue, as noted previously, is whether the President conspired to hide from Congress the fact that contra-support activities, clearly prohibited to CIA, had been transferred to the NSC staff after the enactment of the "full prohibition" Boland Amendment on this issue, I conclude that President Reagan lacked sufficient information about what the NSC staff was doing, and the manner in which Congress was deceived, to support a criminal charge that he conspired to defraud the United States by deceitfully organizing, directing, and concealing a program to continue the funding of and logistical and other support for military and paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by the Contras' operations in Nicaragua. There is no question that the President knew that through some combination of donations and logistical assistance, the Contras were receiving military assistance during the "full prohibition" Boland period; there is also no question that the President would have appreciated that North was the NSC "action officer" for Nicaragua. That much, however, was common knowledge both within the Executive and in Congress, and cannot support a concealment charge. What is missing from the provable knowledge of the President (and was falsely denied in the McFarlane-Poindexter-North responses to Congress) is any clear picture of the critical role that the NSC staff played in providing material support to the Contras' military efforts. The sketchy nature of the information that was provided to Mr. Reagan by his subordinates—particularly when considered alongside those same subordinates' apparent failure to provide the President with key information about how they were raising funds for the Contras, how those funds were channelled, and their absolute control over Contra resupply—does not permit the conclusion that Mr. Reagan knew what was being kept from Congress. Nor can it be proven that the President had any clear idea that Congress was in fact being deceived (as opposed to simply being ignorant) concerning any of the Contra-support activities that the President knew about."<sup>[[46]](https://archive.org/download/reagan-bush-criminal-liability-full/Reagan%3ABush-%20Criminal%20liability_full.pdf)</sup></sup> Ultimately, in substance: Iran/Contra affair is a nothing-burger.

#### Drug allegations:
- The CIA had no involvement drug trafficking, as alleged by Gary Webb. Nor did the CIA (nor any Governmental body) "admit it" as some say. Indeed, CIA welcomed the independent findings of the House Intelligence Committee's 2000 report, which had the final say on the matter. The exact opposite of an admission.<sup>[[47]](https://web.archive.org/web/20000621233942/http://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/press_release/house_pr05112000.html)</sup></sup> There were several independent investigations that could not substantiate the claims and found contradictory information to said allegations. Indeed, the Mercury News backed away from Webb’s scoop. The paper transferred him to its Cupertino bureau and did an internal review of his facts and his methods. Jerry Ceppos, the Mercury News’s executive editor, wrote a piece concluding that the story did not meet the newspaper’s standards.<sup>[[48]](https://ia601300.us.archive.org/7/items/crack-oigreport/CrackOIGReport.pdf#page=48)</sup></sup> The independent investigations include: Many News publications who had independently examined the series, slammed Webb as they found them to be in grave error and unsupported.<sup>[[49]](https://ia601300.us.archive.org/7/items/crack-oigreport/CrackOIGReport.pdf#page=46)</sup></sup> Other, official investigations include: CIA's Inspector General; DOJ's Inspector General; Joint Committee on Contra; the Select Committee on Narc abuse; Crime subcommittee; Foreign Relations Committee; FBI; Special Counsel and lastly the 2000 House Intelligence Committee.

  Despite the many issues identified throughout Webb's articles—it should be noted what it actually didn't allege, and what the outlet tried to correct: As the DOJ IG notes, "Critics and commentators would later debate whether the Mercury News articles in fact accused the United States government of being responsible for the nation's crack cocaine epidemic. In an October 2, 1996, Washington Post article, Gary Webb, the reporter who wrote the Dark Alliance series, asserted that the article had not claimed that the CIA knew about Blandon's drug trafficking. The Washington Post article quoted Webb as saying, "We've never pretended otherwise . . . This doesn't prove the CIA targeted black communities. It doesn't say this was ordered by the CIA.. . . Essentially, our trail stopped at the door of the CIA. They wouldn't return my phone calls." Webb would say as late as June 22, 1997, in an interview with The Revolutionary Worker, "We had The Washington Post claim that the stories were insinuating that the CIA had targeted Black America. It's been a very subtle disinformation campaign to try to tell people that these stories don't say what they say. Or that they say something else, other than what we said. So people can say, well, there's no evidence of this, you know . . . You say, well, this story doesn't prove that top CIA officials knew about it. Well, since the stories never said they did, of course they don't." According to The Washington Post, Mercury News editor Jerry Ceppos stated that he was troubled by the interpretive leap many people made about the article's claims of CIA involvement in the growth of crack cocaine. Ceppos was quoted as saying, "Certainly talk radio in a lot of cities has made the leap. We've tried to correct it wherever we could . . . People [have been] repeating the error again and again and again."

  Approximately a month and a half after the Dark Alliance series was posted on the Mercury News website, the newspaper changed the introduction to the articles, in apparent recognition that certain wording had contributed to the misunderstanding. Rather than stating: For the better part of a decade, a Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to the Crips and Bloods street gangs of Los Angeles and funneled millions in drug profits to a Latin American guerilla army run by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency . . .the Dark Alliance website introduction was altered to read: The Mercury News published a three-part series in late August that detailed how a San Francisco Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to the street gangs of South-Central Los Angeles in the 1980s, sending some of the millions in profits to the Contras. The series never reported direct CIA involvement, although many readers drew that conclusion."

  The 2000 HPSCI report found, "Based on its investigation, involving numerous interviews, reviews of extensive documentation, and a thorough and critical reading of other investigative reports, the Committee has concluded that the evidence does not support the implications of the San Jose Mercury News—that the CIA was responsible for the crack epidemic in Los Angeles or anywhere else in the United States to further the cause of the Contra war in Central America." It goes on to find, "The Committee found no evidence to support the Mercury News allegations that CIA agents or assets associated with the Contra movement were involved in the supply or sale of drugs in the Los Angeles area; The Committee found no evidence to support the allegations that Norwin Meneses, Danilo Blandon or Ricky Ross were CIA agents or assets whose drug trafficking was intended to further the cause of the Contras. Although Norwin Meneses and Danilo Blandon were sympathetic to the Contras, and were trafficking in narcotics, they were not associated with the CIA. Further, Meneses' and Blandon's support of the local FDN organization in San Francisco was not directed by anyone within the Contra movement who had an association with the CIA. Finally, there is no evidence to support the claims of Gary Webb that drug traffickers such as Ronald Lister, Carlos Cabezas, and Julio Zavala were associated with the CIA; The CIA as an institution did not approve of connections between Contras and drug traffickers, and, indeed, Contras were discouraged from involvement with traffickers. Also, CIA officers notified law enforcement entities when they became aware of allegations concerning the identities or activities of drug traffickers."<sup>[[50]](https://archive.org/details/hpsci-cia-contra-crack-report)</sup></sup>
  
  From the Joint Committee, "Our investigation has not developed any corroboration of media-exploited allegations that U.S. government-condoned drug trafficking by Contra leaders or Contra organizations or that Contra leaders or organizations did in fact take part in such activity. During the course of our investigation, we examined files of State, DoD, NSC, CIA, DEA, Justice, Customs and FBI, especially those reportedly involving newspaper allegations of Contra drug trafficking... During the course of our investigation, the role of U.S. government officials who supported the Contras' and the private resupply effort, as well as the role of private individuals in resupply, were exhaustively examined. Hundreds of persons, including U.S. government employees, Contra leaders, representatives of foreign governments, U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials, military personnel, private pilots and crews involved in actual operations were questioned and their files and records examined. Despite numerous newspaper accounts to the contrary, no evidence was developed indicating that Contra leadership or Contra organizations were actually involved in drug trafficking. Sources of news stories indicating to the contrary were of doubtful veracity. There was no information developed indicating any U.S. government agency or organization condoned drug trafficking by the Contras or anyone else.
  
  We have discovered that almost all of these allegations originate from persons indicted or convicted of drug smuggling. Justice has stated that such persons are more and more claiming, as a defense, that they were smuggling for the benefit of the Contras in what they believed was a U.S. government sponsored operation. Typically, they furnish no information which can be corroborated by investigation. In addition to the above-mentioned negative file reviews, interviews with employees of these U.S. agencies have also been negative. Contra leaders have been interviewed and their bank records examined. They denied any connection with or knowledge of drug trafficking. Examination of Contra financial records, private enterprise business records and income tax returns of several individuals failed to locate any indication of drug trafficking." An investigator involved in this examination, a retired FBI Special Agent, reiterates this point and says that "the [Certified Public Accountants] who were charged with auditing the Contra bank accounts found no evidence of influxes of cash attributed to drugs" He says the bank accounts examined included the Contra organization's bank accounts in the Bank of Commerce and Credit International, and personal bank accounts. According to the investigator, the sources of all the money in these accounts were accounted for and much came from third country contributors."<sup>[[51]](https://archive.org/details/appendex-e)</sup></sup>
  
  Some try to suggest a March 2, 1982 to August 3, 1995, Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Attorney General & the DCI under Executive Order 12333, which governed reporting of potential crimes—as evidence of CIA turning a blind-eye. However, sadly for them, as found by HPSCI, "that MOU continued to require CIA to report to DOJ possible violations of "any" federal laws-again thereby including narcotics laws-by CIA employees. However, because of a change in the definition of "employee," agents, assets and independent contractors were moved to the non-employee category and thereby subject to a list of reportable offenses that did not include narcotics violations. The MOU provided that CIA would continue to have the discretion to report any offense by a non-employee to DOJ in addition to the potential crimes that were specified in the MOU. A February 11, 1982 letter from Attorney General William French Smith to DCI William Casey that accompanied the MOU noted that the MOU contained no formal requirement regarding the reporting of narcotics violations by non-employees and urged the CIA's continuing cooperation with DOJ and the Drug Enforcement Administration. This letter did not, however, establish a legal requirement that the CIA report potential narcotics violations by non-employees because no such requirement was included in the MOU. There was no CIA-wide regulation explaining the crimes reporting responsibilities of CIA employees under E.O. 12333 & the DOJ-CIA MOU until December 23, 1987. In August 1995, the 1982 DOJ-CIA Crimes Reporting MOU was revised. Under the revised MOU, assets and independent contractors were again considered "employees" for crimes reporting purposes. Further, narcotics violations were included among the list of "non-employee" crimes that must be reported to the DOJ. A February 8, 1985 internal DOJ memo stated explicitly that there was no requirement for CIA to report non-employee narcotics violations & suggested that the MOU would have to be renegotiated in order to include narcotics violations by non-employees as reportable crimes. 
  
  The Committee concurs with the assessment of the CIA IG that the CIA regulations and policies in effect during the existence of the Contra program did not adequately address the range of drug trafficking matters facing CIA managers and personnel serving in Central America in the 1979-1990 period. With respect to the Contra program, the CIA's regulations and policies did not provide sufficient guidance or procedures for reporting and investigating narcotics trafficking matters: The CIA had no regulations or policies regarding the CIA's responsibilities to identify and pursue allegations or information indicating that organizations or individuals were involved in drug trafficking;  The CIA had no published regulations or policies that addressed CIA employees' contacts with individuals or companies that were known or suspected to have been involved in drug trafficking, unless they were part of a counternarcotics operation or program; and the CIA had no regulations or policies that required that information be requested from DEA, the Customs Service, or U.S. Government law enforcement agencies, other than the FBI, regarding individuals or entities about whom the CIA had knowledge of drug allegations or drug-related information. This led the SSCI to also find, "CIA reporting to DOJ of information on Contra involvement in narcotics trafficking was inconsistent but in compliance with then-current policies and regulations. There is no evidence, however, that CIA officers in the field or at headquarters ever concealed narcotics trafficking information or allegations involving the Contras.<sup>[[52]](https://ia800306.us.archive.org/2/items/hpsci-cia-contra-crack-report/HPSCI%20CIA-Contra%20crack%20report.pdf#page=44)</sup></sup> Per CIA's IG report volume 2, "Executive Branch Requirements. CIA crimes referrals practices pertaining to potential federal narcotics violations were consistent with the applicable provisions of Executive Orders 12036 and 12333, the Attorney General Guidelines under E.O. 12036 and the 1982 MOU between the Department of Justice and CIA under E.O. 12333. No information has been found to indicate that the non-inclusion of narcotics violations by assets in the crimes reporting requirements of the 1982 DoJ-CIA MOU was intended to protect Contra activities."
  
  In interviews with CIA managers and field officers who served in the Contra program, the Committee found that the unwritten policy appears to have been that the CIA should have no official or unofficial relationship with individuals associated with narcotics trafficking. Despite the lack of CIA written regulations or policies on the reporting of drug trafficking allegations, these CIA managers and field officers consistently indicated that such allegations—when they arose-were reported from the field to CIA's OGC where a decision was presumably made about whether to provide the information to DOJ for investigation. These CIA managers and field officers uniformly noted that any actual links between the Contra program and narcotics trafficking would destroy the program's political support. Several senior CIA managers could recollect only a single instance of a report of narco-trafficking by Contra officials during the term of the Contra assistance program.<sup>[[53]](https://ia800306.us.archive.org/2/items/hpsci-cia-contra-crack-report/HPSCI%20CIA-Contra%20crack%20report.pdf#page=45)</sup></sup>
  
  Conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists will often quote wiki which in turn, misleadingly quotes the IG investigations, as to suggest Government misdeeds. First, it must be noted about the difference between them: DOJ's IG examines federal investigation and handling of prosecutions. The CIA IG report is broken into two volumes. Volume 1 focuses on allegations as it relates to individuals involved in smuggling into the US. Vol 2 is general allegations of drug money support to the Contras, etc. "Volume I, The "California Story," addresses findings regarding whether CIA knew of narcotics trafficking by Ricky Ross, Norwin Meneses and Danilo Blandon in Southern California. It also includes findings related to whether CIA knew of the narcotics trafficking activities of Julio Zavala and Carlos Cabezas in Northern California, their possible ties to the Contras and CIA’s contacts with the San Francisco U.S. Attorney’s Office in connection with their prosecution. Volume II, the "Contra Story," addresses CIA’s knowledge of any alleged drug trafficking by the Contras and persons or organizations who supported the Contra program in the 1980s. The investigation on which Volume II is based was not intended to prove or disprove the allegations or information received by the Agency concerning possible drug trafficking by specific individuals or organizations. Further, the description of such allegations or information in Volume II is not intended as representing the judgment of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) regarding the veracity of the allegations or information. The investigation also was not intended to review or evaluate the effectiveness of any CIA programs in Central America in the 1980s. Finally, factual information in Volume II regarding whether particular allegations or information were or were not shared with other U.S. Government agencies or the Congress does not represent a judgment as to whether or not such information was required to be so shared."

  Despite this important caveat, volume 2, finds "No information has been found to indicate that CIA as an organization or its employees conspired with, or assisted, Contra-related organizations or individuals in drug trafficking to raise funds for the Contras or for any other purpose. Contra-Related Organizations." It continues, "Based on this review, several dozen Contra-related individuals and one Contra organization were found to have been the subject of allegations or information concerning involvement in drug trafficking." Further, "CIA received information that one Contra-related organization-the ADREN "15th of September" group—engaged in drug trafficking for fund raising purposes. This anti-Sandinista group formed in 1980 and disbanded in January 1982. No information has been found to indicate that other Contra organizations engaged in drug trafficking for fundraising or any other purpose, although individual members were alleged from time to time to be involved in drug trafficking." On the sharing with law enforcement and other agencies, "Allegations and information indicating drug trafficking by 25 Contra-related individuals was shared in a variety of ways with other Executive branch agencies, including law enforcement agencies as formal intelligence reports, cables and briefings in Washington, D.C.; and the field. However, no information has been found to indicate that any U.S. law enforcement entity or Executive branch agency was informed by CIA of drug trafficking allegations or information concerning 11 Contra-related individuals and assets. Beginning in January 1988, CIA began providing a U.S. law enforcement agency’s regional office in Central America with information received by CIA regarding possible drug-related or other ‘suspicious activities at Ilopango Air Base." It should be noted that, "no information has been found" does not mean it didn't exist—just that the IG could not locate said information. I especially encourgae a full reading of volume 2, line-by-line.

  There are 3 misleading wiki quotes, the first: "In the 623rd paragraph, the report described a cable from the CIA's Directorate of Operations dated October 22, 1982, describing a prospective meeting between Contra leaders in Costa Rica for "an exchange in [the United States] of narcotics for arms, which then are shipped to Nicaragua." However, Volume 2 of the CIA IG report goes on to say "No information has been found to indicate whether a meeting in fact took place in Costa Rica to discuss an exchange of narcotics for arms as described in the October 1982 cable. However, a November 1982 Headquarters cable discussed the alleged meeting and stated: It is HQS opinion that much of information contained in (the October 1982 and November 1982 cables) simply does not make sense (i.e., UDN/FDN cooperation, need to obtain armament through illegal means, shipment of arms to Nicaragua, involvement with the (specific U.S.- based religious organization]). We see a distinct possibility that the (INS) source was either intentionally or unintentionally misinformed."<sup>[[54]](https://ia600304.us.archive.org/5/items/report-of-investigation/Report_of_Investigation.pdf#page=213)</sup></sup>
  
  The second misleading quote, "The report stated that the CIA had requested the Justice Department return $36,800 to a member of the Meneses drug ring, which had been seized by DEA agents in the Frogman raid in San Francisco. The CIA's Inspector General said the Agency wanted the money returned "to protect an operational equity, i.e., a Contra support group in which it [CIA] had an operational interest." However, this ignores the next sentence, "However, the prosecutors state that the decision to return Zavala's money was based on other considerations, not CIA's representations, and that there was no evidentiary value to retaining the money. In any event, the actions taken by CIA to have the cash returned did not appear to be intended to influence the outcome of Zavala's trial, which resulted in his conviction."<sup>[[55]](https://ia800300.us.archive.org/13/items/roi_20240504/ROI.pdf#page=152)</sup></sup>
  
  The DOJ and CIA Inspectors General refute the allegations that Julio was a CIA asset, and supported the Contras. They also refute the allegation CIA intervened in his case. DOJ IG, "In 1982, a federal OCDETF task force targeted a drug trafficking organization in San Francisco. After a lengthy investigation, which included extensive wiretaps, the federal authorities arrested over 50 defendants and seized 555 pounds of cocaine. The case became known as the "Frogman Case," because some of the defendants were arrested in wetsuits while bringing cocaine ashore from a Colombian vessel in San Francisco Bay. Among the defendants later arrested in this case were Julio Zavala and Carlos Cabezas. At the time of Zavala's arrest, approximately $36,000 was seized from Zavala's residence. Prior to trial, defense counsel filed a motion seeking depositions in Costa Rica to show that the money seized from Zavala was not the proceeds of drug trafficking but had been given to Zavala by the Contras. Along with his motion, defense counsel submitted documents from two individuals who claimed they were Contra officials in Costa Rica and had given Zavala $45,000 to "promote the reinstatement of democracy in Nicaragua" within the United States. The court granted Zavala's counsel permission to take the depositions of individuals in Costa Rica to explore the source of the money.
  
  After the court's ruling, the San Francisco Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) handling the case took steps to initiate travel to Costa Rica to take the depositions of the two Contra leaders. Through the State Department, the Costa Rica CIA Station learned about the proposed depositions. The Station mistakenly believed that one of the persons to be deposed was a former CIA asset, not the Contra leader who was identified in the document filed by defense counsel. As a result, an attorney in the CIA General Counsel's office met with the AUSA handling the case in San Francisco, after which the depositions were canceled and the money returned to Zavala. Finally, it was difficult to determine whether the money actually belonged to the Contras or was Zavala's drug proceeds. We concluded, based on the available albeit conflicting evidence, that Zavala or persons acting on his behalf fabricated the claim that it was Contra money rather than proceeds from drug trafficking. We concluded that Zavala engaged in a ploy to salvage some of his drug profits, and the strategy succeeded. At bottom, the allegations of United States government involvement in the drug trafficking of Zavala were clearly a defense tactic and were not based on any credible evidence. Iversen himself described the allegations of outrageous government misconduct as the "theatrical" aspect of the case."<sup>[[56]](https://ia601300.us.archive.org/7/items/crack-oigreport/CrackOIGReport.pdf#page=36)</sup></sup>
  
  As the AUSA noted in a letter-to-the-editor, "We did return $ 36,000 to Zavala. It had nothing to do with any claim that the funds came from the contras or belonged to the contras. It had to do with the fact that it would have cost the taxpayers who were expected by the Court to pay for all travel by all counsel at least that much to fund the excursion to Costa Rica to take the necessary depositions for the problematical result we might be permitted to keep the seized funds. It made no economic sense to me to do this. No " higher ups " were involved, as Congresswoman Boxer wrongfully surmises. The U.S. Attorney had the authority then to compromise claims up to a $ 100,000 ceiling and I exercised that authority. The authority has since been increased to $ 200,000.  While $ 36,000 may seem like a significant sum and people might disagree with our decision to return it, against the background that the cocaine seized had a value of $ 100 million and that we have millions of dollars in property and currency subject to forfeiture in this district at any given time ($20 million at present ) and that little was to be gained from expending valuable agent and attorney time in further quest of what were by comparison "nickels and dimes, "the decision was reasonable, justifiable and I make no apology for having made it."<sup>[[57]](https://ia800300.us.archive.org/13/items/roi_20240504/ROI.pdf#page=140)</sup></sup>
  
  CIA's IG, on the question, "Did any of the individuals who were arrested in 'The Frogman Case' have any relationship with CIA? Were the drug trafficking activities of any of those individuals linked to the Contras?" To which the IG found, "No information has been found to indicate that CIA or individuals acting on behalf of CIA had any relationship with Julio Zavala , Carlos Cabezas, or others who were arrested or charged in connection with the Frogman Case. No information has been found to indicate that Julio Zavala, Carlos Cabezas or other Frogman Case defendants were connected to the Contras or that the Contras benefited from their drug trafficking activities. No information has been found to support Cabezas' claim that he provided financial assistance to the Contras from his drug trafficking activities. While two individuals who were active in the Contra movement wrote letters indicating that the money seized from Zavala belonged to the Contras, it appears this was done through Zavala's wife's connections with old family friends and not because Zavala was active in the Contra movement."<sup>[[58]](https://ia800300.us.archive.org/13/items/roi_20240504/ROI.pdf#page=118)</sup></sup>

   The last misleading quote found in the wiki article, "The report also stated that former DEA agent Celerino Castillo alleged that during the 1980s, Ilopango Airport in El Salvador was used by Contras for drug smuggling flights, and "his attempts to investigate Contra drug smuggling were stymied by DEA management, the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador, and the CIA." Much to the dismay of the conspiracy theorists—none of the allegations were substantiated. Castillo's source denies ever making such claims. Per the DOJ IG report, "The OIG found it difficult to evaluate Castillo's allegations because of their general nature, the passage of time, the refusal by some witnesses to be interviewed, and Castillo's refusal to be interviewed by the OIG except under unacceptable conditions. We nevertheless gathered information relevant to his claims from a number of sources, interviewed many persons connected to the allegations, and reviewed documents from DEA and CIA files related to his claims. We concluded that while some of Castillo's factual allegations had a seed of truth, the inferences he drew from these facts and his broad claims about a conspiracy by the CIA and the Contras concerning drug trafficking were not supported. We found that, in 1986, Castillo did pass intelligence information to DEA Headquarters suggesting that some private pilots who used Ilopango Airport to supply the Contras may have been trafficking in drugs. Sensitive covert operations regarding the supply of the Contras were also being conducted at the same time from Ilopango Airport, and Castillo's investigation of drug trafficking at Ilopango was closed.
   
   Despite the existence of these facts, we did not corroborate Castillo's broad conclusions, particularly that the CIA and the Contras were involved in a conspiracy to smuggle drugs and to obstruct his investigation. The DEA did not have hard evidence to substantiate the charges about drug trafficking at Ilopango, and Castillo's own report about the matter stated that the U.S. Ambassador in El Salvador had permitted Castillo to investigate the claims about Ilopango, but requested that the investigation be discreet. While the CIA and the Embassy were undoubtedly uneasy about a DEA investigation at the airport, we did not find proof that it was because the CIA was involved with or knew about drug trafficking at the airport found that part of the government was not anxious to have DEA agent Castillo openly probe the activities at Ilopango Airport because of sensitive covert operations there. Our assessment of Castillo's allegations was similar to that of a number of his DEA colleagues in Central America, as well as the FBI agent who interviewed him in connection with the Iran-Contra Office of Independent Counsel investigation: Castillo was quick to jump to conclusions based on limited knowledge and little hard evidence, and the evidence Castillo did advance did not corroborate his broad assertions. Castillo's list of relevant files did not support his broad claims of Contra and CIA ties to drug trafficking, and the individuals we contacted about him, including his colleagues in Guatemala, also did not corroborate his claims. Several of his colleagues confirmed that Castillo has a tendency to make allegations without adequate evidence; some have stated that they did not find him to be trustworthy in his claims. But our conclusions about Castillo's allegations do not rely upon general impressions about his credibility. Rather, although some of his claims have a seed of truth behind them, the inferences he draws, and his core claims about CIA support for Contra drug trafficking, were not substantiated by our review."<sup>[[59]](https://ia601300.us.archive.org/7/items/crack-oigreport/CrackOIGReport.pdf#page=38)</sup></sup>

   Further, "Foster said that he did not think that Castillo was a credible witness because, after setting out his own limited direct knowledge, he would proceed to make generalizations that people "had to have known" that other people had drug involvement. This assessment by Foster to us was consistent with his evaluation of Castillo at the time of the 1991 interview. Foster wrote then, after the interview, that in his view Castillo made snap judgments which often were not substantiated. Foster explained in his report: For example, everyone he sees in El Salvador and can't explain is automatically lumped into a group of covert operatives involved in every kind of secretive or illegal activity. He claims everyone knows everything, but he can't articulate it.

The report concluded: We judge that there is little substance to these allegations. There is no evidence that any of [the anti-Sandinista] groups play a role in any drug trafficking operations. If there is a connection it would have to be characterized as a situation in which these groups unwittingly received funds from politically sympathetic drug traffickers or individual Contra members participating in the traffic for their own personal gain.<sup>[[61]](https://ia601300.us.archive.org/7/items/crack-oigreport/CrackOIGReport.pdf#page=53)</sup></sup>

   It has also been alleged since the 80s, and still persists to this day thanks to movies like 'American Made', that CIA used Mena airport, Arkansas, to do drug smuggling with Barry Seal. This was also refuted by an independent investigation: "Adler Berriman "Barry" Seal was never employed by CIA in any capacity. The only limited contact any CIA personnel had with Seal was during a two-day period in 1984 when Seal was involved in a Drug Enforcement Agency string operation that subsequently implicated a Nicaraguan Government official and members of the Medellin drug cartel in a conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the United States. CIA provided technical support to this operation which involved the installation of two 35mm cameras into a C-123K airplane that Seal used during the operation. CIA personnel discussed with Seal options for installing cameras in the aircraft, and instructed him on the methods of operating the cameras. Other CIA personnel who were present had passing or otherwise brief discussions with Seal. During the course of these discussions, Seal was escorted by DEA personnel. No evidence has been found to indicate that CIA knew Seal's true identity prior to the operation or that its personnel had any other contact with Seal before or after this 1984 operation."<sup>[[62]](https://archive.org/details/cia-mena-report)</sup></sup>

   Regarding allegations that Blandon was "protected" from criminal investigation, or tipped off about raids, the DOJ IG finds no evidence to support the various claims here. After Blandon's arrest, he agreed to cooperate with the government in return for a reduced sentence. Blandon was* eventually sentenced to 48 months* in prison, based on his substantial cooperation against drug traffickers. The government later filed a motion seeking a further reduction in Blandon's sentence, based on his cooperation, and the court reduced Blandon's sentence to 28 months... There is no doubt that Blandon obtained a considerable degree of leniency at the behest of the government. In his cooperation agreement, the government agreed to recommend a sentence of only ten years, even though the Federal Sentencing Guidelines would have mandated a far higher sentence -- life imprisonment -- based on the quantity of cocaine Blandon had trafficked in. This agreement, however, was not binding on the sentencing judge. And, when it came time for Blandon to be sentenced, the government filed a motion that allowed the court to give Blandon even less than the ten-year minimum. Thereafter, the government's Rule 35 motion allowed this admitted major cocaine trafficker to leave prison immediately, having served a few months over two years

   The question, however, is not whether Blandon obtained favorable treatment. Cooperators have long received considerable sentence reductions, and the extent of these reductions have become even more significant in the era of mandatory minimums and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Frequently, particularly in the narcotics area, the more substantial the drug dealer, the better his contacts among high-level traffickers -- and therefore, the more able he is to assist in making cases that impress agents and prosecutors and thus lead to substantial sentence reductions. The question here is whether the benefits that Blandon received were in return for his cooperation or because of affiliation with the Contras or the CIA. The OIG has found no evidence whatsoever that the government's efforts to ensure a lower sentence for Blandon were based on anything other than its assessment of his cooperation. There is no evidence of any intervention by the CIA or any intelligence agency. Nor is there any evidence that Blandon received special consideration because of any affiliation with the Contras. While some undoubtedly would argue that the government should give more consideration to the extent of a defendant's prior criminal activity before cutting such a favorable deal, others could equally point out that the case against Blandon was not the strongest, and that the extraordinary leniency he received was commensurate with the extraordinary assistance he gave to the government. We will not resolve this debate, except to note that it extends far beyond the context of this case, is frequently and passionately debated among participants in the federal criminal justice system, and has little to do with the allegations this report addresses."

   The OIG concluded that Blandon improperly received a "green card" -- legal permanent residence (LPR) status in the United States. After Blandon's release from prison in 1994, the INS agent assigned to the OCDETF investigation was given responsibility for obtaining the necessary travel documents so that Blandon could travel to work undercover for the DEA... Although recollections differ on what the INS agent told his supervisors or the immigration examiner who approved the green card concerning Blandon's prior criminal conviction, we concluded that the INS agent knew or should have known that Blandon was not eligible for the green card, and that the agent withheld the fact of Blandon's conviction from the immigration examiner. We concluded that the INS agent took the actions he did because he did not want to expend the additional effort necessary to obtain the travel documents the appropriate way, rather than because of any alleged connection between Blandon and the Contras or the CIA.<sup>[[63]](https://ia601300.us.archive.org/7/items/crack-oigreport/CrackOIGReport.pdf#page=27)</sup></sup>

   In November, 1996, Michael Ruppert, at a town hall meeting, in LA, lied to the attendees that he had first hand knowledge that the CIA has dealt drugs throughout the US for a long time. However, when critically pressed via cross-examination, an independent investigation finds, after a lengthy examination, "Based on our review, we believe that while Ruppert communicates his allegations fervently, they have no firm anchor in reality." Ruppert admitted to investigators that he "had no first-hand knowledge of any cocaine trafficking by the Contras." His claims in the town hall he made the allegations several years earlier, and that he was shot at for it. however, his allegations get more bizzare: "Ruppert reported in 1978 that his problems had begun when he became involved with Nordica Theodora D'Orsay. D'Orsay had claimed to work for an unnamed government agency and claimed to have detailed knowledge of organized crime and the workings of the LAPD. Ruppert came to believe that D'Orsay worked for the CIA and was planning to overthrow the Shah of Iran. According to Ruppert, D'Orsay moved to New Orleans in March 1977 after an attempt on her life, evidenced by a bullet hole in her car. Ruppert later told the FBI he came to believe that D'Orsay had put the bullet hole there herself so she would have an excuse to leave Los Angeles and to prevent Ruppert from finding out who she was and who she worked for."<sup>[[64]](https://ia801300.us.archive.org/7/items/crack-oigreport/CrackOIGReport.pdf#page=165)</sup></sup>

  A seperate independent investigation found, "No information has been found to indicate that Michael Ruppert has ever had any relationship or contact with CIA. Additionally, no information has been found to indicate that Ruppert had any connection with the Contras. No information has been found to indicate that CIA was involved in " Operation Amadeus " or "Operation Amadeous " or that an operation such as that described by Ruppert was ever considered or conducted by CIA. No information has been found to indicate that there was any "sheep dipping" program—presumably, use of LAPD as cover for CIA officers—involving CIA and the LAPD . No information has been found to indicate that Ruppert's former girlfriend, Theodora D'Orsay, has had any relationship or contact with CIA."<sup>[[65]](https://ia600300.us.archive.org/13/items/roi_20240504/ROI.pdf#page=75)</sup></sup>

  Lastly, some may attempt to reference a quote by David MacMichael, however, his quote  lacks authority, as he was only a contract analyst for CIA, for two years. The media examined his role as an outside analyst during this period, finding, "Although he did work for the CIA as an outside contractor, only about half his time was spent on Central America. His assignment was not arms supplies or military action, but political analysis of internal opposition to the Sandinista regime." Journalists also found out who was behind David's media blitz: The Caribbean Basis Information Project. The CBOP, it turns out, is.a hard-line single-issue advocacy group working to discredit and reverse President Reagan's Central America policy. The group had connections to Castro's UN Mission. In sum: He had no expertise or access to information relevant during his brief contract, and was being peddled by then-recently created, Castro-backed orgs—the regime that was being supported by Castro.<sup>[[66]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00806R000100200008-0.pdf)</sup></sup>

   Despite the conspiracy theories, Garry Webb did indeed commit suicide. No, there was not "two shots to the back of the head". The shots were near his ear, from the side. One bullet missed and went through the cheek due to uncontrolled shaking, the last finished it. Further, yes, it is possible to have two gunshot wounds to the head in suicide. These have been documented long-before Webb's death, and many, many since. Aside from forensic evidence proving it was suicide, His ex-wife at the time also confirmed it would have been suicide, "The way he was acting it would be hard for me to believe it was anything but suicide," she said. According to her, Webb had been unhappy for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper. He had sold his house the week before his death because he was unable to afford the mortgage.<sup>[[67]](https://www.editorandpublisher.com/stories/gary-webbs-death-confirmed-as-suicide,109995)</sup></sup> <sup>[[68]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004140050065)</sup></sup> <sup>[[69]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12780)</sup></sup> <sup>[[70]](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-mar-16-et-webb16-story.html)</sup></sup>
   
- Conspiracy theorists allege that the CIA was connected to the Cubana de Aviación Flight 455 bombing, on 6 October 1976. Only 2 of the 4 responsible had past contacts with the CIA. Luis Posada Carriles and Orlando Bosch Avila. The USG had no foreknowledge of the incident.

  Posada arrived in the U.S. in February 1961 as a political refugee. Soon after his arrival, Posada joined the 2506 Brigade and received paramilitary training in Guatemala under CIA auspices in preparation for the Bay of Pigs invasion. Posada probably received at least rudimentary familiarization training in demolitions in the Guatemala camp. From March 1963 to March 1964 Posada was in the U.S. Army at Fort Benning, Georgia, finishing up as a Second Lieutenant and Commanding Officer of a Weapons Platoon in a Ranger Battalion. In the latter function Posada would very likely have received demolitions training. In March 1965 Posada was recruited by CIA to serve as a Maritime Training Branch instructor in Florida. His file indicates that he was reported to be a "demolitions expert" (at the time of his hiring in March 1965). Posada was also utilized as a source on Cuban exile activities. In 1965 Posada was involved with Luis Sierra Lopez who was working with Roberto Alejos Arzu, a Guatemalan citizen who was attempting to overthrow the Guatemalan Government. Posada was of interest to the Sierra/Alejos group because of his knowledge of demolitions and weapons. Posada reported fully to CIA, and later to the FBI, on his involvement in and the activities of this group (and subsequent other Cuban exile activist organizations with which he became affiliated). As of August 1966 Posada was used solely as an informant on the activities of the Cuban Representation in Exile (RECE), a Miami-based Cuban exile group. He was formally terminated in July l967. In August 1967 Posada moved to Caracas, Venezuela and secured a position with DIGEPOL, the Venezuelan security service (now known as DISIP). He was formally terminated on 30 June 1974. Infrequent contact was maintained with Posada, however, until February 1976 because of certain out-standing U.S. Federal Income Tax problems Posada had because of his (then) status as a Permanent Resident Alien (PRA) of the U.S. In mid-February 1976, Posada recontacted to volunteer a report on the whereabouts Orlando Bosch Avila, Frank Castro, and on a threat to the life of Salvador Allende's nephew. The final contact between the Agency and Posada occurred on 22 June 1976 when Posada contacted to request visa assistance for his wife and himself; the assistance was denied.
  
  Orlando Bosch Avila is a well-known Cuban exile activist who is subject to arrest upon re—entry to the U.S. as a parole violator. The Agency was in contact with Bosch in Miami from approximately January to November 1962. Bosch was under consideration as an "external coordinator" in the Evelio Duque exile group. Bosch was to assist the Agency and Duque in formulating operational plans for infiltration (into Cuba) teams. Bosch did obtain safehouses and procured food supplies for the Duque teams, and assisted Duque in drafting operational plans for the infiltration teams. Available information in Bosch's file does not indicate any Agency contact with Bosch subsequent to November 1962 for this purpose. Later, on 31 October and l November 1963, a representative of the Agency met with Bosch in New York City twice. These two meetings were in connection with efforts by Bosch to secure financial support for air strikes (mounted from Central America) against Cuba. Bosch at this time was the General Coordinator of the Insurrectional Movement of Revolutionary Recovery (MIRR). Bosch was informed through an intermediary on either 2 or 3 November 1963 that no financial support would be forthcoming. There is no available information in Bosch's file that indicates any Agency contact with Bosch subsequent to 1 November 1963.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/BACKGROUND%20INFORMATION%20ON%5B15926778%5D.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  It should be noted that: Bosch was tried by a Venezuelan military tribunal in 1980 and acquitted due to a lack of evidence. He was tried in civil proceedings in 1986 and acquitted. due to insufficicnt evidence. Bosch spent I0 years in prison during proceedings. In 1987, a Venezuelan higher court upheld Bosch's acquittal and he was released. As of April 1992, Bosch was living in Miami under restricted parole (for crimes committed in the US). Posada Carriles escaped from Venezuelan prison before he could be tried. US had no information on his whereabouts in 1992.<sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/BACKGROUND%20INFORMATION%20ON%5B15926778%5D.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- It was alleged that the CIA, in El Salvador, supported right-wing death squads, and encouraged security service abuses—during hostilities between Salvadoran security forces, right-wing groups and left-wing terrorists. This has been a thoroughly debunked USSR hoax, to cover the USSR's support for left-wing death squads and terrorists.<sup>[[1]](https://library.brown.edu/create/modernlatinamerica/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2013/08/Special-Report-on-Communist-Interference-in-El-Salvador.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1279408/soviet-support-for-international-terrorism-and.pdf)</sup></sup> Indeed, 3 seperate, independent investigations concluded as much: The House Intel Committee; the Senate Intel Committee and the Inspector General. US pressure, public and private, saw success at moderating security services, the military, police, and overall civic affairs. During the free and fair election of Duarte, a number of reforms took place, most important was judicial. From the House Intel Committee, "The staff's investigation looked at press reports and materials from private organizations alleging a range of US intelligence activities with reference to death squads. These allegations can be summarized as follows: 1) That US intelligence trained, organized, financed and advised Salvadoran security forces that engaged in death squad activities; 2) That US intelligence was aware of torture and killing by Salvadoran security services and death squads, and in some cases participated in such killings.

  The Committee staff conducted a comprehensive review aimed at providing as much information as could be gathered bearing on these allegations. It reviewed intelligence reporting on death squads as well as the intelligence tasking which established priorities for intelligence collection. The Staff examined all intelligence reporting bearing on death squads from 1979 to present. It reviewed State Department cables bearing on the same subject. The staff conducted interviews with numerous intelligence officials knowledgable about intelligence activities in El Salvador from 1979 to 1984. The staff also reviewed in detail a CIA Inspector General report requested by the Committee in connection with H. Res.467. This report reviewed CIA operational relationships that might have involved members of death squads. Finally, the staff made additional requests for information. The staff review of operational intelligence relationships leads it to conclude that US intelligence agencies have not conducted any of their activities in such a way as to directly encourage or support death squad activities. To the contrary, US intelligence activities have been directed, sometimes successfully, at countering death squad activity, reducing the power of individuals connected with death squads, and seeking their removal from positions of authority.
  
  The staff has uncovered no evidence that US intelligence officials or US intelligence policy in any way encouraged torture by Salvadoran security service or by any death squads. To the Contrary, all that the staff can discover indicates US intelligence efforts to moderate the behavior of Salvadoran security service and armed forces personnel to prevent such activities. Further, as the US has learned more about death squad activity, and as it has concentrated more policy attention on this subject, some improvements have taken place. The staff points in this regard to the exile from El Salvador of certain officials identified by the United States as having death Squad connections."<sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/death-squad-investigation)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/98659.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Further, under continued US pressure, the respect for human rights in El Salvador increased dramatically. Though, there were a few reports that tried to suggest that human rights improvements had not occurred, many of them were infiltrated by KGB-backed terrorists and were discredited.<sup>[[5]](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/45332/F-2017-01476_19870608_C00440541_doc.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00589R000100040004-9.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://archive.org/details/el-salvador-report)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c070986841&view=1up&seq=530&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754074682596&view=1up&seq=63&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-91-166.pdf)</sup></sup>  

  An independent 1993 panel examined US State Department and Foreign Service handling of human rights issues involving El Salvador from 1980 to 1991. The Panel reviewed the public and State Department record, including classified documents. It interviewed over 70 individuals, inside and outside the Department, who were directly involved. It convened a public hearing and heard testimony from 25 witnesses. It paid particular attention to nine of the most egregious cases of human rights abuse reported by the United Nations Truth Commission in March 1993. The Panel's basic conclusion is that, within the parameters of overall U.S. policy, the Department and Foreign Service personnel performed creditably—and on occasion with personal bravery—in advancing human rights in El Salvador: (1) Ambassadors consistently pushed their staffs to prepare honest, detailed human rights reports for Washington concerning specific abuses and the overall situation. (2) Reporting officers pursued cases aggressively, and the Embassy put steady pressure on the Salvadoran government and military to bring perpetrators to justice. (3) Enormous effort was expended, and modest progress achieved, in developing El Salvador's institutional capacity to deter and punish human rights abusers. A formal instruction from Secretary Shultz to his ambassador in El Salvador in mid-decade put the matter succinctly: In order to ensure El Salvador's security and stability in the short and long term, it was necessary to have “not only a high level of support against the current guerrilla threat, but also assistance in building and consolidating institutions which will lead to Salvadoran national reunification, more peaceful and representative political and judicial processes, and economic development." A specific goal was to “continue to strengthen El Salvador's moderate political center and to promote further development of representative democratic institutions and full respect for human rights."

  Strong underlying forces ensured that the promotion of human rights would be a critical element of U.S. policy toward El Salvador despite the changes in rhetoric. First, there was an assumption in the State Department that the Salvadoran government and society had to reform and develop a friendly, stable government supported by its people or there would be no hope to avoid an FMLN takeover. Without reform, military aid would be wasted. Second, without improvements in the barbaric human rights practices in El Salvador, support in the United States for aid to that government would collapse. Pressures from Congress, the American public, and interests groups made progress on human rights issues key to continued U.S. assistance. Third, the Foreign Service reflects the nation it serves: human rights are an integral part of what we stand for as a nation and by the 1980s had become an accepted part of the American diplomatic agenda. Fourth, there were legal requirements to prepare the annual Human Rights reports, certifications of Salvadoran human rights performance, etc. As one former Assistant Secretary summed it up for the Panel: “There was no way to sustain our policy toward El Salvador without an aggressive approach on human rights. It was essential morally and politically." The files contain reports of sustained efforts by U.S. ambassadors in San Salvador and other members of the Administration to pressure the Salvadoran government and military to improve their record on human rights throughout the period. There is nothing in the record to suggest official indifference on this issue. U.S. ambassadors in San Salvador pressed their message firmly throughout the period that U.S. support for El Salvador was unsustainable if the human rights violations continued. Most did so publicly, as well as in private. The techniques applied included trips to the country by Vice Presidents Bush and Quayle and visits by many senior Washington officials, statements by U.S. leaders to Salvadoran visitors, numerous general and specific démarches by U.S. ambassadors, and continuing efforts by members of the Embassy to get results on specific cases of human rights abuses.

  The most dramatically successful of these efforts was the trip by Vice President Bush in December 1983. His message to assembled officials and military leaders was blunt: stop the death squads or the President and I will lead the charge in stopping aid to El Salvador. His entourage provided a list of leading military figures who had to be moved out of command positions if U.S. aid were to continue. The State Department and the Embassy felt that the best approach to managing the Salvadoran problem was to build a civil society with appropriate institutions that could develop links between the government and the people and provide the basis for progress in human rights and other areas. Current and former officials whom the Panel interviewed held that Saivadoran society in the early eighties had become so polarized that the only hope for the country's future stability was to build a political center. The military had been running the country for a long time and had contempt—sometimes justified—for the corruption of the civilian governmental structure. The constraints on the civilian leadership's power were readily observable. The Embassy, therefore, worked closely with Presidents Duarte, Magana, and Cristiani to devise ways to increase the power of civilian authorities in the country and encouraged military leaders to accede to this change. It strongly supported elections to pull political forces from the extremes to the center and give the winners the legitimacy necessary to govern. It sought to professionalize the army and inculcate more humane values in its ranks. The U.S. Government also worked hard to create an improved security and judicial system. The judiciary, however, was badly intimidated and shied away from any action on controversial cases.

  The U.S. made a conscious decision to work through existing organizations both to increase their experience and prestige and to ensure the reforms had a "made in El Salvador" tag so they would last. As Assistant Secretary Enders told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early 1982, the Department believed that, though the judicial system was “very largely inoperative," the investigation of prominent cases had to be carried out within the Salvadoran system if it were ever to begin fulfilling its proper functions. He added that, "We are asking them not only for justice, we are asking them to make the judicial system work, because it is an essential ingredient of human rights in any country."

  A sweep by the Atlacatl Battalion through the town of El Mozote and the surrounding area in December 1981 became a cause célébre when a massacre of Civilians there was reported in late January in the New York Times and the Washington Post. Embassy San Salvador was skeptical of the report (it was publicized the day before President Reagan issued a required certification that the human rights situation in El Salvador was improving). The January 27 stories prompted the Embassy to carry out its own investigation. It sent the assistant defense attaché and a human rights officer to the area. They were unable to get to the site—which had returned to rebel control—but they flew over it by helicopter and talked to people in the vicinity. The Embassy reported its conclusions in a cable dated January 31. The summary stated: “Although it is not possible to prove or disprove excesses of violence against the civilian population of El Mozote by government troops, it is certain that the guerrilla forces who established defensive positions in El Mozote did nothing to remove them from the path of battle which they were aware was coming and had prepared for, nor is there any evidence that those who remained attempted to leave. Civilians did die during Operation Rescate but no evidence could be found to confirm that government forces systematically massacred Civilians in the operation zone, nor that the number of civilians killed even remotely approached number being cited in other reports circulating internationally." It noted they were still pursuing the question of what army units were present in El Mozote. The reporting officers quoted an aged couple who fled the town during the attack as saying they saw dozens of bodies. The mayor of a nearby town was unwilling to discuss the comportment of government forces saying "this is something one should talk about in another time, in another country." He and a priest both agreed that many of the refugees in this nearby town were from guerrilla families. The conclusion of the cable noted that the area was war-ravaged with the government controlling the towns, the guerrillas the countryside, and “most civilians attempt[ing] to Maintain a tenuous neutrality." With El Mozote in guerrilla hands since August 1981, the reporting officers felt "the inhabitants were certainly passive and probably active guerrilla supporters." The cable noted inconsistency in the reported numbers of deaths, adding its estimate that no more than 300 people were in the entire canton. It noted that various contacts in the area had been unable to provide first-hand information on El Mozote, that the officials had visited "locations throughout Morazan" on January 30 and interviewed inhabitants and refugees from El Mozote and nearby cantons.

  Ambassador Hinton was clearly uncomfortable about jumping to conclusions on El Mozote. He complained to the Department on February 1 about a cable that referred to his “denying” the incident. “I would be grateful if Department would use extreme care in describing my views on alleged massacre," he wrote, noting that he had said he had no confirmation of it and no reason to believe Radio Venceremos. He added, however, that “additional evidence strongly suggests that something happened that should not have happened and that it is quite possible Salvadoran military did commit excesses." He also dismissed the Salvadoran Defense Minister's denial as "stonewalling without credibility” and told the Minister that something had "gone wrong" with the operation. The next day he pressed him to name the leaders of the battalion involved. The Defense Minister responded by calling the stories a "novella" and a "pack of lies." In May the Embassy reported it had attempted to establish a data base for further investigation of the events in El Mozote, but said it was “unable to reach a definite conclusion regarding civilian deaths" there. Reviewing all available sources, it felt that none of them “concretely indicate that anywhere near 1,009 civilians were massacred there. The El Mozote issue then appears to have been lost in the flood of ongoing embassy business.

  The assassination of Archbishop Romero in March 1980 was a brutal beginning to a terrible year in El Salvador. The Embassy, the Department, and White House quickly condemned the murder, and the Embassy concluded early that it had been carried out by the extreme right. Information obtained by the Embassy later that year and in 1981 blamed the murder on the right-wing leader Roberto D'Aubuisson. Salvadoran investigations tended to fall apart quickly. A major complication developed when D'Aubuisson and his ARENA party became a strong political force as the electoral process moved forward. U.S. pressure helped keep D'Aubuisson out of the Salvadoran presidency, but the Embassy dealt intermittently with him in the effort to move El Salvador’s political extremes toward the center. President Duarte used the widespread suspicions of D'Aubuisson's involvement in the Archbishop's assassination as a political weapon against him, and after winning the 1984 presidential election put the newly-formed Special Investigations Unit (SIU), financed by the U.S. Government, on the case to develop new leads. The U.S. Government strongly supported this effort and worked to extradite a key figure from the United States in 1987-88, but the effort was blocked by D'Aubuisson's supporters in the judiciary. His political rival President Duarte summed up the D'Aubuisson problem for Ambassador Corr by listing three levels of proof: moral—he was morally sure D'Aubuisson had ordered the Archbishop's assassination; police—he did not have enough evidence to arrest him; and judicial—even if he could get D‘Aubuisson arrested, there was no basis to prove his guilt in a court. The Embassy and the U.S. Government walked a difficult line on this case. It worked hard to help Duarte and the judicial authorities to build a case against D'Aubuisson and at various periods refused to have anything to do with him or give him a visa to the U.S. It also sought, successfully as it turned out, to channel his popularity to the service of building a strong civil culture in El Salvador. Despite a decade of trying, however, neither the Salvadoran nor U.S. authorities was able to bring anyone to justice for Archbishop Romero's murder. 

  When Salvadoran soldiers arrested and murdered ten people in San Sebastian on September 21, 1988, they knew they could be in trouble and put out a cover story that the prisoners had been killed in an ambush. The Embassy was skeptical of the military's story and pressed for a prompt, impartial investigation of the case. An Embassy officer stayed in close contact with the investigation, which soon had to be turned over to the SIU. The military continued to stonewall President Duarte as well as efforts by the Embassy until the case was made a critical element in Vice President Quayle's visit in early February 1989. The military then agreed to carry out a genuine investigation and asked for FBI help. Having completed its investigation, the Salvadoran High Command announced on March 11th, that it believed that nine active duty personnel were responsible for the killings and turned them over to the civilian courts for prosecution.

  The Panel concluded there was no truth to the view, voiced widely in the eighties, that the Reagan Administration's perceived downgrading of the importance of human rights issues sent ambassadors and reporting officers scurrying to trim their sails. In fact, the human rights reporting from Embassy San Salvador was found to be good, carefully written, and generally voluminous.<sup>[[11]](https://archive.org/details/el-salvador-93panel_202307)</sup></sup>

- On May 1989, General Noriega attempted to nullify Panama's democratic election, where Guillermo Endara had rightfully won. Following this, the US engaged in a prolonged effort to engage diplomatically via the OAS, to persuade Noriega to honor the election results. He did not. On the first of September, the same year, he illegally appointed a new provisional government, headed by his loyalists—after a coup failed, against this coup, he declared that Panama was in a state of war against the US. US soldiers and civilians were killed and wounded after this declaration of war, as well as unlawfully detained. On 20 December, 1989, Operation Just Cause was launched. The United States lawfully invaded the Republic of Panama to overthrow the unelected dictatorship of General Manuel Antonio Noriega. By capturing the general, defeating the military forces he commanded, and returning the country back to the rightful, democratically-elected government. There are many authoritative studies on Operation Just Cause, detailing its success, legality, context, and rebuilding efforts under civic and humanitarian activities.<sup>[[1]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-91-174fs.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://history.army.mil/html/books/just_cause/CMH_55-1-1_Just_%20Cause_opt.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/History/Monographs/Just_Cause.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Apr/05/2001727349/-1/-1/0/B_0061_SHULTZ_AFTERMATH_WAR.PDF)</sup></sup> Further, sensational headlines alleged that Noriega was provided intelligence by the CIA, and/or other Agencies and departments. However, thorough investigations revealed this was not the case.<sup>[[5]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90G01353R001400100001-9.pdf)</sup></sup> In general, the government acknowledges that Noriega was a paid asset of the Army and held a paid relationship with the CIA, at  $160,000. He provided information to the government in return for that payment. That information ranged from incidental information to the negotiating posture of the Panamanian government during the Panama Canal negotiations. In addition, he supported U.S. government programs in Panama, some of which were important intelligence operations, and some of which were routine military or diplomatic exercises. During this time, however,  the fact is that for years the intelligence community received inconclusive and circumstantial evidence that Noriega was involved in drug trafficking, but they were unaware of hard evidence. Eventually, new witnesses became available, and slowly but surely prosecutors assembled facts before a grand jury.

  Noriega, due to his position in history, is attempting to recast that history to his benefit. As an accomplished intelligence officer, he extracts facts which are neutral to him and attempts to reset them in a contrived context which casts him in a positive, but decidedly historically revisionist, light. His CIPA 5 Notice is a concatenation of otherwise unrelated classified information with Noriega's sometimes important, sometimes unimportant and sometimes non-existent participation in the center. One of the more serious allegations, debunked, was Operation Watchtower, supposedly an activity in which beacons were set up in Panama to guide aircraft from Colombia to U.S. military bases In Panama. As far as the government can tell, this "operation" is actually the fabrication of an Individual who is serving a life sentence In Walpole State Prison In Massachusetts for killing his wife. In that operation, he claims that the beacons were designed to help drug traffickers bring drugs through Panama to the United Stator. His knowledge of this plan, according to him, is what led American special forces agents, all of whom happen to be dead today, to kill his wife and to frame him in the process. When he first sent this information to a variety of public authorities and to the media, the Army Investigated each of the allegations. It was unable to corroborate then. In the process, the Army concluded that the Affidavit submitted by the prisoner attached to his own documents, which affidavit had apparently been signed by a deceased Army officer, was probably written by the name person who wrote the prisoner's own documents.<sup>[[6]](https://archive.org/details/noriega_202401)</sup></sup>


- On October 1983, Grenada found itself in a state of 0 governance, and mass violence, in which Embassies for various countries, including the US, were attacked. In response to a formal request by the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), whom these democratic states voted for action, under the 1981 treaty, due to the growing violence in the leaderless state, the US led the joint effort to restore order and peace. The limited stability operations led to very few civilian casualties. "Grenadian casualties were 45 killed and 337 wounded. 24 of the Grenadian dead were civilians, 21 of whom were killed in an unfortunate bombing of a mental hospital located adjacent to an anti-aircraft installation. 24 Cubans were killed and 59 wounded of the approximately 800 Cuban 'construction workers' on the island... By December 15, all U.S. combat forces had withdrawn; among the U.S. forces only training, police, medical and support elements remained."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170129131916/http://insidethecoldwar.org/sites/default/files/documents/Grenada%20A%20Preliminary%20Report%20December%2016%2C%201983.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/lessons-of-grenada)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://history.army.mil/html/books/070/70-77/cmhPub_70-77.pdf#page=82)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.latinamericanstudies.org/grenada/Grenada-Documents.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86B00420R000501160010-8.pdf)</sup></sup>

- During the 1980s, allegations from the Baltimore Sun, reported in 1995, allegations of CIA's complicity in Honduran human rights abuses of the Battalion 3-16 (316), etc. This triggered then-DCI John M. Deutch to direct a review of the allegations, from the 1980s to 1995, the review, known as the Honduras Working Group concluded, "there is no information in CIA files indicating that CIA officers either authorized or were directly involved in human rights abuses." Some issues remained unresolved, and reported this to CIA Executive Director Nora Slatkin. In July 1996, she requested the Inspector General investigate these outstanding matters. The IG report corroborated the Working Group's findings, "No evidence has been found to substantiate the allegation that any CIA employee was present during sessions of hostile interrogation or torture in Honduras." It also found no connection to the CIA in connection to, or evidence of the existence to ELACH, an alleged right-wing paramilitary organization; nor involved in any attempts to cover-up or downplay reporting. These two reviews independently corroborated a 1988 IG investigation that found no CIA aid or connection to any human rights abuses. An OGC review also confirmed CIA had no involvement in, planned, or otherwise connected to Olancho Operation. CIA policy regarding interrogations, and human rights in general is best described in a January 14, 1985 HQ cable: "...Intervewing and interrogation of suspect in custody is a method routinely used by police, security and intelligence services around the world. In many countries, legal and basic rights of the suspect in custody may not be given full consideration, resulting in deprivation of his/her human rights. CIA policy is not to participate directly in nor to encourage interrogation that results in the use of force, mental or physical torture, extremely demeaning indignities or exposure to inhumane treatment of any kind, as an aid to interrogation. CIA policy is to actively discourage the use of these methods during interrogations. CIA should play a positive role in influencing foreign liasion to respect human rights." Participation includes being in the room during an interrogation, sitting in an adjoining room monitoring the interrogation or providing questions while an interrogation is in progress. 

  A March 1976 HQ cable described CIA's Human Rights Policies and guidance: "...employees must be especially sensitive to the political and possible legal ramifications of what the CIA does. This cable also included a description of CIA officer's responsibilities if it were to be discovered that a host or third country intelligence or security service was about to undertake actions that could reasonably be construed to be gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. CIA personnel  also were advised in this cable that, as a general rule, they should make appropriate efforts to prevent or delay such actions..."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000159944.pdf)</sup></sup>

- The US had no involvement in the Argentina military coup in 1976. For over a year prior to the March 1976 coup, U.S. government officials and other observers consistently characterized the situation in Argentina as “deteriorating.” Both the press and U.S. intelligence agencies reported on political instability and uncertainty, especially in coverage of the inner circle of President Isabel Peron, the Argentine congress, and military leaders. Crime and terrorism disrupted daily life in Argentina, and due to Cold War foreign policy priorities, U.S. government agencies generally paid more attention to the threat of terrorism committed by ideologically leftist than by rightist groups. Leftist guerrilla groups operating in both the cities and the countryside—the Montoneros and ERP—seemed to be gaining followers and control over certain geographic areas, successfully financed their operations through kidnapping and extortion, sometimes targeted U.S. citizens, and increasingly seemed able to repulse the efforts of the Argentine security forces to contain them. At the same time, right-wing death squads with links to the Peron government and the security forces, notably the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance (Triple A), increasingly targeted labor leaders and left-wing Peronist political leaders as well as leftist guerrillas.

  Throughout 1975 and into early 1976, U.S. officials in Argentina repeatedly warned Washington that a coup was likely due to crime, violence, and instability under the government of Isabel Peron. The coup came on March 24, 1976 when an Argentine military junta removed Peron from power. The U.S. gave limited support to the new government, through the end of the Gerald Ford Administration in January 1977. U.S. officials in Buenos Aires and in Washington also reported on the ideology and actions of the junta, including about human rights violations, throughout 1976. Officials tried to glean the character of the new government, concluding that it would likely be “moderate” but that the U.S. government “should not become overly identified with the junta.” Officials also repeatedly wondered if junta president Jorge Videla, the commander of the army, had enough control over the security forces to end human rights abuses—or if an end to human rights abuses was even one of Videla’s goals. In July, the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires reported to Washington that estimates of the number of people who had been illegally detained “run into the thousands and many have been tortured and murdered.” In response to the dramatically increasing volume of such cases, U.S. Ambassador to Argentina Robert C. Hill protested to the Argentine government concerning human rights abuses in May 1976. In July, Assistant Secretary of State Harry Shlaudeman told Kissinger that the Argentine “security forces are totally out of control” and that the U.S. would “have to wait until somebody surfaces to get a handle on this.” In September, Hill protested again, directly to Videla, that “not one single person has been brought to justice or even disciplined” for violations of human rights. In response, Videla said that “Kissinger understood their problem and had said he hoped they could get terrorism under control as quickly as possible.”

  The Carter Administration’s emphasis on human rights in U.S. foreign policy heavily influenced its approach to Argentina. In addition, during 1977 and 1978 the Carter Administration’s policy toward Argentina was shaped by the Kennedy-Humphrey Amendment (P.L. 95-92, sec. 11), a Congressionally-mandated halt on all U.S. military aid, training, and arms sales to Argentina, which was enacted in August 1977 and went into effect on October 1, 1978. The Carter Administration also had other goals for its policy toward Argentina. U.S. policymakers wanted to moderate and encourage an end to the military government and a return to elective democracy, prevent Argentine disputes with its neighbors from devolving into war, prevent Argentina from working towards becoming a nuclear power, and encourage the stabilization and growth of the Argentine economy, which suffered from high inflation rates. Officials struggled to balance these competing interests, many of which required discussions with and persuasion of Argentine officials, with the new pressure from the White House, Congress, victims’ relatives, and NGOs to get the Argentine government to demonstrate real improvement on human rights issues. There were disagreements among U.S. officials about the rate at which the junta’s human rights record was improving, but no one at this stage tried to argue that the military government deserved the unwavering support of the United States.

  By early 1977, most U.S. officials believed that the leftist guerrilla groups had been defeated, and that the vast majority of the continued detentions, torture, and disappearances were perpetrated by people or groups accountable to the Argentine government and unrelated to any real threat from the armed left. U.S. Ambassador Raul H. Castro continued to press the junta to improve its performance on human rights, to return to democracy, and, at times, to account for the missing and punish those responsible for abuses. The U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires also continued to collect data on human rights abuses, documenting 9,000 kidnappings and disappearances and conducting interviews with those who had been detained or who were searching for missing relatives.

  The disagreement inside the U.S. government was over exactly what tactics to use to change the regime’s behavior and how to identify the better actors within Argentina’s ruling circles. During 1977 and most of 1978, the impending new ban on arms sales, aid, and training provided the U.S. with some leverage, as did the U.S. vote on Argentine loans in International Financial Institutions (IFIs) like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. However, policymakers did not always agree on how to use those points of leverage, or about what exactly to tell their interlocutors in the Argentine government about how the U.S. interest in promoting human rights would affect other areas of relations.

  As early as May 1976 and throughout 1977, some U.S. policymakers thought Videla would act as the necessary “moderate.” When he spoke with U.S. envoys, Videla promised he could compel the junta to publish lists of the state’s prisoners, release a few high-profile prisoners, and release others into voluntary exile. Ultimately, these U.S. officials wanted to support Videla to help him balance the U.S. demand for improvements in human rights with the demands of Argentine military hardliners who opposed “concessions” to the U.S. on human rights. These U.S. officials wanted the U.S. to vote in Argentina’s favor in the IFIs and argued for the approval of arms transfers before the Kennedy-Humphrey embargo went into effect, believing that these moves would support Videla’s claim to the junta presidency. Other U.S. policymakers did not trust Videla. They believed that maintaining pressure on Videla and the junta as a whole for improvements in human rights should be prioritized over other U.S. interests in Argentina. They wanted the government of Argentina to face concrete sanctions if it did not halt its abuses—they opposed arms transfers and wanted the U.S. to vote against Argentine loans in the IFIs.

  Disappearances in Argentina slowed to a trickle by the early 1980s, but it is unclear whether this improvement was primarily due to pressure from the U.S., to an internal decision made by the Argentine junta in its war against perceived leftists, or to other factors. Carter’s human rights pressure also pushed the junta to look for allies elsewhere who were less focused on human rights, including in the Eastern bloc and the Soviet Union.

  The Reagan administration sought to improve U.S.-Argentine relations and focused on private diplomacy regarding human rights in Argentina. They worked to restore military ties between the two anti-communist counties and to weaken or overturn the 1978 Kennedy-Humphrey Amendment’s restrictions on military aid to Argentina. Reagan and his Secretary of State, Al Haig, viewed Carter’s public criticisms of Argentina as misguided and thought that any valid concerns about human rights abuses by the Argentine military should be raised privately. Thus, when the Argentine military junta replaced Videla with Roberto Viola as president in March 1981, Haig told Viola that there would be “no finger-pointing” regarding human rights, adding: “if there are problems, they will be discussed quietly and confidentially.” Reagan agreed, telling Viola that “there would be no public scoldings and lectures.” With warmer bilateral relations secured and disappearances apparently on the wane, the Reagan administration felt that it could make progress on many of the central issues faced by Carter: stabilization of an economy that was in deep recession and carrying massive foreign debt, nuclear proliferation and the ratification of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, Argentina’s lack of participation in the grain embargo against the Soviets, and a return to electoral democracy. Reagan was also interested in securing Argentine assistance in securing his administration’s goals in Central America, particularly in El Salvador.

  Optimism waned when Leopoldo Galtieri, installed as president by the junta in December 1981, decided that invading the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands would shore up his government, which faced dire economic problems, labor unrest, and growing public displeasure with military rule. When Argentina lost the war against the United Kingdom over the islands, the junta was widely discredited for its human rights abuses, economic mismanagement, and the loss of the war. In December 1982, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams privately told Argentine Ambassador to the U.S. Lucio Alberto Garcia del Solar that the question of “children born to prisoners or children taken from their families” was “the gravest humanitarian problem” that the military government of Argentina faced, as it tried to negotiate an amnesty with political parties looking toward elections that would restore democracy in Argentina.

  The democratic election in October 1983 brought about the civilian leadership of Raúl Alfonsín, but the country’s economic problems, which had been exacerbated by the war in the South Atlantic, remained. Alfonsín struggled to chart a new role for the military in Argentine society and to find a politically workable balance between prosecutions and amnesty for the perpetrators of human rights abuses. He also needed U.S. assistance with solving the country’s foreign debt crisis.<sup>[[1]](https://www.intel.gov/argentina/history)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/STEPS%20TO%20IMPROVE%20U.S.-ARG%5B15503036%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79T00865A002600130001-0.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Despite claims by historical revisionists who claim the US Government was part of "operation condor." The facts reveal the opposite: It did not create, condone, participate or ignore the activities several Latin American countries engaged under Operation Condor. These facts are all but confirmed in declassified documents. A 22 August, 1978 memo, from CIA to Ambassador Landau, "operation condor" is a cooperative effort by the intelligence/security services of several South American countries to combat terrorism and subversion. The original members included services from Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil and Bolivia; Peru and Ecuador recently became members. The Agency's first knowledge of the organization's existence came in March 1976 when [redacted] reported that Manuel Contreras, then chief of the Chilean DINA, had initiated a program of cooperation between intel services , called "Plan condor."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/MEMO%20ABOUT%20OPERATION%20COND%5B15502884%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> A 24 July, 1976 memo to the Deputy Director for Central Intelligence, by Chief Latin America Division says, "it raises the question of what action the Agency could effectively take to forestall illegal activity of this sort. Also, every precaution must be taken to ensure that the Agency is not wrongfully accused of being party to this type of activity."<sup>[[2]](https://ia804708.us.archive.org/33/items/condor-memo/Condor%20memo.pdf)</sup></sup>

  A August 17, 1976 memo  from the Chief, Latin America Division sent to the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, "'Operation Condor' has been the subject of previous correspondence to you and other senior officials of the Agency; it has also generated considerable correspondence [redacted] in recent months and has prompted discussions with senior officials of the Department of State as to what action the U.S.G. could take in an attempt to assure that human rights are not violated by the countries involved in "Condor." The most significant of the foregoing documents are attached for your review. In addition, the following is a precis of "Condor" and an assessment [redacted] of the the possible adverse political ramification for the Agency should "condor" engage in assassinations and other flagrant violations of human rights. [redacted] indicating that the efforts by the security services of the southern cone countries to undertake a regional approach to meet a regional terrorist threat, ie "condor", would go well beyond the exchange of information—to include plans to assassinate selected JCR leaders in [redacted]. In an attempt to preempt potential political ramifications for the Agency, should the "Condor" countries proceed with the European aspect of their plans, we have taken the following action. As soon as we learned of the possible [redacted]. In addition, discussions were held with senior officials of the Department of State relating to the steps which could be taken to dissuade the South America countries from their planned course of action. Accordingly, agreement has been reached on the text of an EXDIS message from the Department of State to the U.S. Ambassadors in Buenos Aires, Santiago, and Montevideo instructing them to approach the highest levels of their host governments and express the serious concern of the US Government to the alleged assassination plans envisioned within "operation condor." The host governments would be informed, however, that the U.S. takes no issue with "Condor" plans to collect and coordinate information to counter regional terrorism in the southern cone area. The State Department approach described above could well have some adverse impact on the security of the [redacted]. In any case, it is our judgement that the potential repercussions must be accepted in order to counteract the negative aspects of "Condor." This memo was concurred by the Deputy Director for Operations.<sup>[[3]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/POTENTIAL%20POLITICAL%20AND%20S%5B15499948%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=6)</sup></sup>

  A declassified State Department INR analysis, on the US diplomacy with Latin American countries on human rights issues, notes the problems the US faces with those nations, "In the case of Condor, the potential for problems is greater. If Condor operatives begin assassinating opponents in Latin America and/or Western Europe, human rights will almost certainly become an even more critical issue in our bilateral relations with the nations involved. The likelihood of additional aid cutoffs would increase, and a general souring of our relations within the region would probably result."<sup>[[5]](https://plancondor.org/sites/default/files/2023-04/n0002-arg-dos-declass-hr-latam.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Some allege as evidence the US was involved, is a telegram, from a US Ambassador to Panama, which, is mischaracterised as admitting that a US communications facility was used by Condor to conduct its operations. However, this is a mere lie. The telegram concerns the Embassy in Paraguay to the Department of State. It recounts information provided by Chief of Staff General Alejandro Fretes Dávalos, which, in turn, provides the acta or summary minutes resulting from the visit of General Orozco, Chief of Chilean Intelligence, to Asunción. The telegram reads, "The document is basically an agreement to coordinate all intelligence resources in order to control and eliminate subversion. It speaks of exchange of information, prompt use of communication facilities, monitoring of subversives and their detention and informal hand over from one country to the other. It repeats over and over the need for full cooperation and mutually facilitative acts in the context of a fight to the death against subversion. In response to my questions, Fretes Dávalos gave the following account of the meeting between Chile and Paraguay. It was simply another in a regular series of meetings which take place annually among the Chiefs of Intelligence of the countries of the Southern Cone. This system of consultations came into being mainly as a defense against the threat of Argentine subversion spreading to other countries. Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay make of the net, although Uruguay is now almost on the inactive list. Fretes Dávalos said the meetings are not particularly useful anymore, in his judgment, because the main threat (from Argentina) has been eliminated. They keep in touch with one another through a U.S. communications installation in the Panama Canal Zone which covers all of Latin America. This U.S. communications facility is used mainly by student officers to call home to Latin America but it is also employed to co-ordinate intelligence information among the Southern Cone countries. They maintain the confidentiality of their communication through the U.S. facility in Panama by using bilateral codes. In his view the whole network is practically useless and serves mainly to permit Chiefs of Intelligence to exaggerate their own diminishing importance.

  Comment: Obviously this is the Condor network which all of us have heard about over the last few years. Although Fretes Dávalos told me he had only mentioned to President Stroessner that we were going to talk about the meeting, I suspect the president vetoed Fretes’ stated intention of providing me with a copy of the ACTA and instead told him to read it to me. Either I misunderstood or Fretes misspoke in our previous meeting (RefTel) when he said Argentina had also attended. Appearently two bilateral meetings with Chile and Argentina took place one after the other and some sessions may even have overlapped.

  Recommendation: The two FBI agents here tell me there is likelihood Condor will surface during Letelier Trial in the U.S. If General Fetes Dávalos is accurate in describing the communications it uses as an encryped system within U.S. communications net (and I have no knowledge whether this is true), it would seem advisable to review this arrangement to insure that its continuation is in U.S. interest."<sup>[[6]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1977-80v24/d34)</sup></sup>

- No, the CIA did not "admit" to the 1973 coup. To quote from the 2000 Hinchey report, "As part of a Track I strategy to block Allende from taking office after the 4 Sept election, CIA sought to influence a Congressional run-off vote required by the Constitution because Allende did not win an absolute majority. While Allende was in office, the 40 Committee approved the redirection of Track I operations to strengthen opposition political parties. Under Track II, CIA sought to instigate a coup to prevent Allende from taking office in the 4 Sept election & before, Congress' vote. CIA worked with 3  groups of plotters. Contact with 1 group was dropped early on because of its extremist tendencies. The third group, acting independently of the CIA at that time, attempted to kidnap Schneider, mortally wounding him in the attack. Although CIA provided weapons to one of the groups, we have found no information that the plotters’ or CIA’s intention was for the general to be killed. In addition to Viaux, CIA had established contact with other coup-plotters, including General Camilo Valenzuela.  Valenzuela’s group was well known by the Station and was judged to have the capability to carry out a successful coup.  CIA provided this group—which also saw the abduction of General Schneider as essential to any coup—three submachine guns, ammunition, and 8 to 10 tear gas grenades on 22 October. (These weapons were later returned unused to the Station.) Valenzuela’s representative insisted his group had nothing to do with Schneider’s killing and that Viaux acted on his own. As the Church Committee found, "Although the CIA continued to support coup plotters up to Schneider’s shooting, the record indicates that the CIA had withdrawn active support of the group which carried out the actual kidnap attempt on October 22, which resulted in Schneider’s death. Further, it does not appear that any of the equipment supplied by the CIA to coup plotters in Chile was used in the kidnapping. There is no evidence of a plan to kill Schneider or that United States officials specifically anticipated that Schneider would be shot during the abduction."
  
  Both Track initiatives ran simultaneously until Congress elected Allende on 24 Oct. After the 1970 election, CIA kept contacts on Chilean military officers in order to continue intel collection activities, however, there was no effort to assist them. As coup rumours and planning escalated by the end of 1972, CIA exercised extreme care in all dealings with Chilean military officers and continued to monitor their activities but under no circumstances attempted to influence them. By Oct 1972 the consensus within the US government was that the military intended to launch a coup at some point, that it did not need US support for a successful coup, and that US intervention or assistance in a coup should be avoided. When CIA's station in Chile became convinced that opposition had shifted towards a coup, CIA HQ reaffirmed to the Station that there was to be no involvement with the military in any covert action; there was no support for instigating a military coup." Per a Senate staff report, "was the United States involved in the 1973 coup in Chile? The Committee has found no evidence that it was. Did the U.S. provide covert support to striking truck-owners or other strikers during 1971-73? The 40 Committee did not approve any such support." Further, "transcripts of a phone conversation between Kissinger and Nixon reveal that they did not have a hand in the final coup."<sup>[[1]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=12)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=13)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/94chile.pdf#page=6)</sup></sup>

  Historian Robert Hathaway finds, "CIA continued to monitor Chilean affairs after Allende’s inauguration, and by some measures its interest incrcased. Within the Western Hemisphere Division, Broe created a separate branch dealing exclusively with Chilean matters, in recognition of the administration’s heightened concern. Budgetary figures also reflect this augmented interest. In the months preceding Allende’s accession to power, the Agency had spent between $800.000 and $1 ,OOO,OOO on covert action in Chile.  These funds financed extensive clandestine activities, including support for opposition political parties, propaganda operations, and covert backing for the media. This extensive involvement logically flowed from the assumptions and commitments behind both Tracks I and II. A memorandum that DDP Karamessines wrote after his 15 October 1970 meeting with Kissinger when the National Security Adviser directed the Agency to break off ties to Viaux, clearly demonstrates this linkage. Karamessines records that Kissinger ended this meeting by noting that the CIA "should continue keeping the pressure on every Allende weak spot in sight—now, after the 24th of October, after S November [sic; Kissinger probably meant 3 November, inauguration day], and into the future until such time as new marching orders are given." Later, before the Church committee, Karamessines expanded on this:

     'As far as I was concerned, Track II was really never ended. What we were told to do in effect was, well, Allende is now President. So Track II, which sought to prevent him from becoming President, was technically out, it was done. But what we were told to do was to continue our effort. Stay alert, and to do what we could to contribute to the eventual achievement of the objectives and purposes of Track Il. That being the case, I don't think it is proper to say that Track II was ended.'

  Karamessines's explanation is misleading, since once Allende was in-stalled, there is no evidence that US policy or CIA action ever had his overthrow as an objective. National Security Decision Memorandum 93, however, gives some background that helps explain the sense in which Karamessines evidently considered Track II still alive. Adopted six days after Allende's inauguration, this document set forth official American policy toward Chile. While the US Government would be publicly "correct but cool" toward the new regime in Santiago, behind the scenes it would seek "to maximize pressures on the Allende government to prevent its consolidation and limit its ability to implement policies contrary to US and hemisphere interests." The Agency's clandestine activities after the installation of the new Chilean leadership appear to have followed this directive, approved at the highest levels of the government. The Agency's efforts to "maximize pressures" on the Allende government, however, did not go so far as actively to promote the coup in September 1973 that toppled President Allende. In this respect Karamessines's ambiguous reference to continuing Track Il is seriously misleading. The Church committee, not known for its tenderness toward the CIA, spent months searching for hard evidence of direct American participation in the events leading to Allende's overthrow and death but ultimately failed to produce any. The record, the committee concluded, indicated that CIA maintained "a careful distinction between supporting the opposition parties," on the one hand, and "funding private-sector groups trying to bring about a military coup" on the other."<sup>[[4]](https://ia600503.us.archive.org/31/items/RichardHelmsasDirectorofCentralIntelligencehelmsasdcia/Richard%20Helms%20as%20Director%20of%20Central%20Intelligence%20helms_as_dcia.pdf#page=88)</sup></sup>

  In March 1974, on the six-month anniversary of the Junta’s establishment, Pinochet verbally attacked the Christian Democratic Party and stated that there was no set timetable for the return to civilian rule.  On 18 December 1974 Pinochet was declared Supreme Leader of the nation. During this period, CIA, in coordination with the Department of State, determined that no new or expanded covert action activities were to be carried out until the 40 Committee provided new authorization.  Although covert action spending was authorized for previously obligated expenditures and commitments in programs described above, no new initiatives were authorized.  By June 1974 CIA covert action plans for Chile had been officially terminated, and payments ceased. Although some of these residual propaganda operations may have benefited Pinochet and the putchists indirectly, officers of the CIA and the Intelligence Community were not involved in facilitating Pinochet’s accession to President nor the consolidation of his power as Supreme Leader.  For most of the period, CIA had no covert action authority for Chile. While the CIA had liaison relationships with various security services over the years, there is no indication that any service asked for, or that the CIA offered, any assistance to promote Pinochet to the Presidency.<sup>[[5]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=14)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=15)</sup></sup> 
   
  CIA admonished Chilean agents against human rights abuses. CIA officers & assets were tasked to report on human rights violations by the government. During a period between 1974 & 1977, CIA maintained contact with Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who later became notorious for his involvement in human rights abuses. The US Government policy community approved CIA's contacts with Contreras, given his position as chief of the primary intelligence organization in Chile, as necessary to accomplish the CIA's mission, in spite of concerns that this relationship might lay the CIA open to charges of aiding internal political repression. From the start, the CIA made it clear to Contreras was that it would not support any of his activities or activities of his service which might be construe as "internal political repression." In its contacts with Contreras, the CIA urged him to adhere to a 17 January 1974 circular, issued by the Chilean Ministry of Defense, spelling out guidelines for handling prisoners in a manner consistent with the 1949 Geneva Convention. In May and June 1975, elements within the CIA recommended establishing a paid relationship with Contreras to obtain intelligence based on his unique position and access to Pinochet. This proposal was overruled, citing the US Government policy on clandestine relations with the head of an intelligence service notorious for human rights abuses. However, given miscommunications in the timing of this exchange, a one-time payment was given to Contreras.<sup>[[7]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=16)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=17)</sup></sup> CIA actively used its contacts, especially with members of services notorious for human rights abuses, to emphasize that human rights abuses were detrimental to the government's credibility within their own country, damaging their international reputation, & unacceptable to the US Government.<sup>[[9]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=15)</sup></sup> Further, A review of CIA’s files has uncovered no evidence that CIA officers and employees were engaged in human rights abuses or in covering up any human rights abuses in Chile.<sup>[[10]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=20)</sup></sup>

   It should be noted that the previously-mentioned Senate staff report did have some major errors—by how it characterised what happened: "The Chairman then introduced the staff director, who  with other members of the staff, summarized a staff report entitled, "Covert Action in Chile 1963-1973."The staff conclusion was even more specific: "In the period 1970 through 1973, in order to prevent a Marxist leader from coming to power by democratic means, the U.S. worked  through covert action to subvert democratic processesthis interference in the internal affairs of another country served to weaken the party  we sought to assist and created internal dissensions which, over time, led to the weakening and, for the present time at least, an end to  constitutional government in Chile." These assertions, and the Committee report on which they are based, are misleading because they make it appear that the United States was responsible for the downfall of a respectable and truly democratic government. The real character of  Allende and his coalition was ignored by excluding both public statements of philosophy and intent as well as the public record of highly  illegal actions while in office. Omitting publicly available information (not to mention the exclusion of voluminous classified intelligence dealing with Chilean support of Soviet and Cuban international subversion) makes it difficult for the American public to understand why anti-Allende operations were undertaken by three successive U.S. administrations. 

   It also cannot be overstated the dictatorship that Allende favoured over strong, traditional democratic institutions and processes. Communist Party leaders were largely in charge of the economic program of the Allende government. The communists intended gradually to replace private enterprise by State enterprise, thus enabling the government to assume complete social and economic power. The government, therefore, drew up a list of all Chilean corporations whose capital reserves exceeded $500,000. These companies, representing 82% of the capital holdings of all companies incorporated in Chile, were earmarked for nationalization. Congress attempted to block this government program by passing legislation defining the economic areas subject to government ownership, but the government continued to take over Chilean firms, using methods which became progressively more illegal. These methods ranged from expropriations (declared unconstitutional by the Chilean Supreme Court) , to requisitions (many of which were declared illegal by the Chilean Office of the Comptroller General) "decrees of insistence" (a rarely used judicial tool created to resolve differences of legal interpretations between the judiciary and the executive). In agriculture, all farms exceeding 80 hectares of irrigated land were made subject to legal expropriation. These "legal" expropriations were supplemented by those of roving armed bands who took possession of agricultural properties by force without any intervention by the Chilean police. Similarly, a series of economic pressures was exerted to silence the independent media, including coercion, bribery, the manipulation of government control over credit, imports and prices, and the incitement of strikes.
  
   As an adjunct to economic pressures, the Allende government began to develop the concept of "popular power", creating parallel revolutionary organizations which duplicated the functions of existing legal organizations. For example, special communal commands, known as JAPS, were established to control the distribution of essential articles, mainly food. Government supplies were channeled through these new organizations rather than through established retailed outlets. Of Soviet origin, the communal commands had the dual function of displacing "bourgeois" organizations and of training their members for armed revolution. Prior to the Allende regime, Chile had a strong democratic tradition and a firm commitment to constitutional processes. Under the Allende regime, its institutions fought long and tenaciously to save themselves from destruction by legal, constitutional means. When the government violated Chilean law, protests were filed with the courts and "contraloria." When the courts and the Contraloria objected to these violations, however, the government either paid no heed to these decisions or over-ruled them through "decrees of insistence", which were themselves illegal. The National Congress also tried to check these violations of the law by impeaching the ministers responsible for them, but Allende merely moved the ousted ministers from one post to another, thus thwarting the purpose of Congressional sanctions. Finally, when all the protests of the Congress, the courts and the Contraloria had been repeatedly ignored, these bodies solemnly declared that the Allende government had placed itself outside both the law and the Constitution. These declarations were made by the Supreme Court on May 26, 1973, by the Contraloria on July 2, 1973, and by the Chamber of Deputies on August 22, 1973. The Chamber's declaration was, in fact, a notice to the armed forces that the legal and constitutional order of the country had broken down."<sup>[[11]](https://archive.org/details/chilereview)</sup></sup> <sup>[[12]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=txu.059173026788036&view=2up&seq=6&q1=Report+of+the+Bar+Association)</sup></sup>

   Lastly, a last-ditch effort by conspiracy theorists and historical revionists will try linking fake news headlines suggesting the US declassified documents that admit it, in 2021 and in 2023—these are Nixon's Presidential daily briefs and records from Australia. However, much to the dismay of the authors—a simple reading of the primary sources, rather than the headlines—just reveals what was already documented: CIA was aware of coup plotting rumours. Nothing specific.

- In 1969-1970, it was stated by Soviet propaganda, that Dan Mitrione (who was a U.S. Agency for International Development officer), was a CIA operative, and ran a torture campaign in Uruguay. Mitrione was kidnapped by the Tupamaros terrorists—who cited the Russian disinformation book as to how they learned he was a US Government employee, simply because his name appeared there, and that he had a role, as an alleged CIA operative, trained riot Police, they knew nothing about the unfounded accusations of torture.<sup>[[1]](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/stratperspective/inss/Strategic-Perspectives-11.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Dominican Republic 1915-1965. There was a succession of weak and corrupt governments in the Dominican Republic (DomRep) in the years that followed, repeatedly overthrown by revolts, whose promoters and adherents did little to strengthen the nation's economy or the public's well being. The financial situation became so bad, corruption so prevalent, and the debt load so crushing that the United States took control of DomRep customs in 1905, and did not relinquish the hold until 1941. The U.S. imposed an economic council on the republic in 1915, as a result of continual disorder and chaotic mismanagement, and in 1916 instituted a military government backed by a U.S. Marine expeditionary force. When this force withdrew after the election of a constitutional government in 1924, it left behind a well-trained native police force.<sup>[[1]](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/U_S_%20Marine%20Corps%20Operations%20In%20The%20Dominican%20Republic%20April%20-%20June%201965.pdf#page=12)</sup></sup> And no, this isn't an example of "American imperialism." As one historian concludes, "Roosevelt thus expanded the Monroe Doctrine into a claim for the United States of international police power in the Western Hemisphere--power which was to be used, not to create a colonial empire for the United States, but rather to prevent other nations from establishing new colonies of their own."<sup>[[2]](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/Marines%20in%20the%20Dominican%20Republic%20PCN%2019000412600.pdf?ver=2018-10-30-075158-293)</sup></sup> One of DomRep's officers, Rafael Lnidas Trujillo Molinas, anambitious, ruthless, and talented opportunist, managed to have himself elected President in 1930. During the next 30 years, the Trujillo family and their favored sycophants, particularly the officer corps of the armed forces, systematically ravaged DomRep, for their personal gain. While the dictator achieved some measure of economic and administrative stability during his rule, he did so at the expense of the basic human rights of his people. DomRep was a police state, a place of fear and death for any who opposed "The Benefactor of the Republic."  

  "There was no direct American participation in the assassination of Rafael Trujillo in May 1961, (who himself had been involved in an attempt to assassinate the President of Venezuela). The idea originated with the Dominicans; they acquired some of the weapons on their own; and they did the detailed planning. They were never subject to American supervision or control." Some Latin American countries thought the US had allowed his brutal regime, however, it was just US policy to refrain from actions that would hasten his downfall. On March 10, 1960, the CIA drafted a plan to persuade dictator Trujillo to retire. The plan was for Clark to approach Trujillo, with whom he had been on good terms in the past, and attempt to persuade Trujillo to retire. It was to be pointed out that there was no one who could succeed him, and that to protect his family and to preserve his image as El Benefactor, he should step down and allow asylumn to be arranged for him. His family would have the wealth already outside the Dominican Republic, and the fortune inside would be placed in trust, to be administered by  internationally-known personages for the benefit of the Dominican people. This proposition received high-level attention in Washington, including that of President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Herter, and Allen Dulles. In approving Clark's approach to Trujillo, the President specified that Clark should travel as a representative of the State Department, rather than as a personal emissary of the President. General Clark traveled to the Dominican Republic and met with Trujillo on 27 March. By the time of the meeting it appears that it had been decided that the plan would be presented as merely that of private citizen Clark, and that was what was done. The station thought it likely that Trujillo recognized the official U.S. Government hand in the proposal. Of course, nothing came of the meeting.

  Eventually, Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom told J. C. King on 28 June 1960 that the U.S. Government was prepared to participate in the overthrow of the Trujillo regime to the extent of providing a small number of sniper rifles for the removal of key Trujillo people from the scene. General Cabell, as Acting DCI, on 1 July 1960 approved delivering 12 Springfield rifles to the Dominican dissidents by air drop or by sea. The rifles were never delivered. On 10 February 1961 the chief of station cabled a suggestion that one small-size, high-fire-power weapon be forwarded in each pouch. This suggestion was not acted upon. On 17 March 1961, the chief of station cabled a request of Consul General Dearbon for the pouching of three 38 caliber Smith and Wesson Special pistols for delivery to key members of the dissident group. Headquarters was preparing to pouch the pistols but apparently did not do so. There is no indication in the operational files that the pistols were actually pouched. The request for pistols appears to have been overtaken by a subsequent request for submachine guns. On 26 March 1961 the station cabled a request for permission to pass three semi-automatic M-1 carbines plus ammunition to redacted. The carbines and ammunition  were in the consulate, having been left by departed naval personnel. The station requested that headquarters pouch magazines. Headquarters approved passing the carbines and ammunition and pouched the magazines. The cable authorizing passing the carbines was released by the DD/P (Bissell). The station said it would file off the carbines’ serial numbers. The station cabled that the carbines were passed to redacted on on 7 April 1961. Redacted at the request of the dissidents, gave the carbines to redacted for temporary safekeeping. Redacted later recovered the carbines from redacted and gave them to Antonio de la Maza, who reportedly kept them in the trunk of his automobile. It is probable that at least one of the carbines was taken to the scene of the assassination by de la Maza, but we have no evidence that it was actually used in the shooting. While at headquarters for consultations in early April 1961, Chief of Station redacted evidently prevailed upon headquarters, to pouch four M-3 submachine guns and ammunition to the station. The submachine guns were pouched and arrived at the station on 19 April 1961. Headquarters cabled the station on 17 April that the submachine guns were not to be passed to the dissidents without additional headquarters approval. Despite repeated pleas from the Chief of Station and from the Consul General, Washington continued to refuse authorization to pass them. We think it is safe to conclude that the submachine guns were never passed to the dissidents."<sup>[[3]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/RAFAEL%20TRUJILLO%2C%20THE%20DOMI%5B15603377%5D.pdf#page=61)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32112922.pdf#page=2)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Between 1961 through 1965 and beyond, CIA engaged in clandestine activities to create an atmosphere which will foster a democratic revolution. This was done through support of democratic institutions, labour unions, student groups, social justice groups, sponsor self-help programs such as cooperatives, community development programs, credit unions, and other activities.<sup>[[6]](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-100-doc2.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  The immediate cause of the civil war lay in the May 1961 assassination of Generalissimo Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina and the ensuing political chaos. By April 1965 two powerful factions had emerged, the Loyalists and the Constitutionalists. The Loyalists, supported by Colonel Elias Wessin y Wessin who commanded the 1,500 man autonomous Armed Forces Training Center, backed the government led by President Donald Reid Cabral. The Constitutionalists, supported by elements of the military, backed the exiled socialist politician Juan Bosch, who had briefly held the Dominican Republic’s presidency in 1963 before being ousted in a coup, and wanted his liberalizing constitution reinstated. On 24 April 1965 President Reid revoked the military commissions of several young officers suspected of planning a coup against his government. In response, they revolted, adopted the label of Constitutionalists, and persuaded approximately 1,500 soldiers and a unit of the Dominican Navy’s elite frogmen to join their cause. The Constitutionalists made radio announcements and distributed 20,000 weapons throughout Santo Domingo. The military units aligned with the Constitutionalists and armed civilian groups began attacking police, buildings of rival political groups, and occupying strategic positions throughout the city. Despite a pre-revolt strength of over 17,000 men, the Dominican military’s personnel loyal to Reid’s government were divided and disorganized. Only Wessin y Wessin’s 1,500 AFTC soldiers and elements of the Dominican Air Force were capable of immediate action.

  Operation Power Pack. Within a few days in April 1965, the U.S. was compelled to take drastic steps which it found distasteful but necessary. In response to the rapidly deteriorating situation on 25 April President Johnson directed the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to prepare to evacuate American nationals. Two days later, unarmed Marines from the USS Boxer helicoptered to Haina (ten miles south-west of Santo Domingo) to evacuate American civilians brought from the Hotel Embajador in Santo Domingo. The next day a battalion of Marines landed at Haina, proceeded to the Hotel Embajador, and established a helipad on the nearby polo field from which nearly 700 civilians were evacuated. Unfortunately, the situation in Santo Domingo continued to deteriorate. On 28 April harassment of Americans continued, the U.S. embassy came under sniper fire, and Ambassador William Bennett reported “collective madness” engulfing the city. After receiving an early morning written request on 29 April for help from the Loyalists, at 1930 hrs President Johnson authorized the use of overwhelming force to stabilize the situation. Soldiers from the 82d Airborne Division and Marines from the 6th Marine Expeditionary Brigade were dispatched to reinforce the embassy, protect American nationals in Santo Domingo, and prevent a communist takeover. The President recognized that by bypassing the Organization of American States (OAS), American unilateral action would cause diplomatic tensions with OAS members, but he remained confident enough members could be convinced to offer support after the situation improved.

  The stability operations, which lasted from 30 April to 3 May, can be separated into three phases: 1) The landing at San Isidro Airfield (about ten miles east of Santo Domingo); 2) The eight mile advance west from the airfield to the Ozama River; 3) The establishment of a line of communications to link the airfield with the International Security Zone (INSZ) around the US Embassy, thereby separating the two factions. The operation was based on JCS Operation Plan 310/2-63, which had been rehearsed several times, but did not include current political or geographic information.<sup>[[7]](https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/dominican.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/U_S_%20Marine%20Corps%20Operations%20In%20The%20Dominican%20Republic%20April%20-%20June%201965.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://archive.org/details/the-dominican-republic-crisis-of-1965-text)</sup></sup> 
  
- Between the 1960s and 1974, the US Agency for International Development (AID) begun a world-wide program to help train police in various countries to develop better professionally, including respect for human rights. While results varied, it should be noted, contrary to conspiracy theorists and political pundits, that the CIA was not involved with AID's Office of Public Safety, by which this activity was run.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP73B00296R000100020105-3.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-92-118.pdf)</sup></sup> Some may try to suggest the Special Group CI is evidence of CIA's involvement—however, such programs were just "scrutinized" by SGCI.<sup>[[3]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v08/d102)</sup></sup> 

- In Bolivia, 1971, CIA made a one-time payment to discourage a reportedly imminent coup and to “cement relations” with Bolivian military figures. Unknown to the CIA, a coup would follow two days later.<sup>[[1]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve10/d76a)</sup></sup>

- The basic covert action goals in Bolivia are to foster democratic solutions to critical and social, economic, and political problems; to check Communist and Cuban subversion; to encourage a stable government favorably inclined toward the United States; and to encourage Bolivian participation in the Alliance for Progress. US President Johnson took office in 1963, he inherited a longstanding U.S. Government policy of providing financial support for Bolivian political leaders. The policy was intended to promote stability in Bolivia by strengthening moderate forces, especially within the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) itself, which had a strong left wing under the leadership of Juan Lechin Oquendo, General Secretary of the Mine Workers’ Federation. In August 1963 the 5412 Special Group approved a covert subsidy to assist the MNR to prepare for the presidential elections scheduled for May 1964. The Special Group agreed in March 1964 that the MNR receive additional financial support. Paz won the election; Lechin (who had been Vice President under Paz) left the government and founded a rival leftist party. Covert action expenditures in Bolivia between fiscal year 1963 and fiscal year 1965 were as follows: FY 63—$337,063; FY 64—$545,342; and FY 65—$287,978. The figure for FY 65 included funds to influence the campesino movement, for propaganda, to support labor organizations, and to support youth and student groups. The FY 66 program also allocated funds to support moderate political groups and individuals backing General Barrientos for President.

  On November 4, 1964, the new Vice President, General René Barrientos Ortuño (MNR), led a successful military coup d’etat, forcing Paz into exile, (No US involvement in coup). In February 1965 the 303 Committee authorized a financial subsidy to the MNR under Barrientos (who was aware of U.S. financial support to the MNR) to help establish an organizational base for the presidential election scheduled for September. In May 1965 Barrientos responded to growing labor unrest by arresting and deporting Lechin and postponing the election. The 303 Committee, which considered a recommendation to support Barrientos as the best available candidate, agreed in July 1965 and March 1966 to authorize additional funds for MNR propaganda and political action in support of the ruling Junta’s plans to pacify the country and hold elections to establish a civilian, constitutional government.

  When the presidential election was finally held in July 1966, Barrientos won easily, and officials concerned with the covert operation concluded that the objectives of the program—the _end of military rule_ and a _civilian, constitutional government_ whose _policies would be compatible with those of the United States—had been accomplished._<sup>[[1]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v31/d147)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://sgp.fas.org/advisory/state/bolivia.html)</sup></sup>

- By March 1964, it appeared to many in Brazil, and around the world that Goulart was "definitely engaged on campaign to seize dictatorial power". As the "immediate tactics of the Goulart palace guard are concentrated on pressures to secure from the Congress constitutional reforms unattainable by normal means, using a combination of sporadic rural violence, and abuse of the enormous discretionary financial power of the federal government." Combined with subjecting radio and TV outlets to a partial censorship, increasing the use of the National News Agency and requisitioning broadcast time for its reformist propaganda, and making thinly veiled threats against the opposition press. The purpose is not in fact to secure constructive social and economic reforms, but to discredit the existing constitution and the Congress, laying a foundation for a coup from the top down which might then be ratified by a rigged plebiscite and the rewriting of the constitution by a rigged Constituent Assembly." To counter this, the declassified record has only shown that the US, "covert support for pro-democracy street rallies, discreet passage of word that USG deeply concerned at events, and encouragement democratic and anti-Communist sentiment in Congress, armed forces, friendly labor and student groups, church, and business." No evidence has been found that the US was involved directly or indirectly in the coup.<sup>[[1]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v31/d187)</sup></sup>

- In 1964 the US covertly supported an independent British Guiana (Guyana), by funding various left/moderate minority-group political parties for upcoming democratic elections, to reach the goal of a moderate Government that would pursue a multi-racial policy, and engage in realistic social and economic development programs. Initially the US worked with Cheddi Jagan, but he became more racist and aligned with the Soviet Union, since the PPP militia requested and started to receive KGB covert aid.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20141018135832/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000112273.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/Guianaoverview)</sup></sup>
  
- In 1962, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the DoD approved a draft plan, in response to Soviet missile crisis in Cuba, known as Operation Northwoods, which authorised (but never conducted): Start rumours; Land friendly Cubans in uniform "over the fence" to stage attack on base; capture (friendly) saboteurs inside base; start riots near base (friendly Cubans); blow up ammunition inside the base; start fires; sink ship near harbor entrance.; Conduct funerals for mock-victims; fake a shootdown of a remotely piloted aircraft.

 - 1960-1962, CIA's activities against Castro. A number of allegations stem from a poor reading of selective documents, out of thousands: that assassination and sabotage was a main and integral part of anti-Castro activities, including the use of the mafia. An authoritative declassified historical study on the subject finds this is not so: "By way of summarizing, it would appear that CIA's official anti-Castro program as reflected in Project JMATE did not include assassination as an integral part of its operational planning... In terms of Project JMATE itself, the few bits of information which indicate the possibility of assassination attempts against the Cuban leadership also fail to demonstrate any responsibility for their initiation on the part of WH/4. If anything, the evidence would indicate that WH/4's position was one of watchful waiting and wishful thinking that dissident Cubans would themselves eliminate the Castros and Che Guevara. The possibility, of course, that Agency-supplied weapons might be involved in such an attempt cannot be ruled out. Obviously it would be foolish to contend that those principally responsible for developing CIA's anti-Castro program would have objected to the assassination of Fidel Castro. On the other hand, this was not one of the basic concepts nor intentions of the official program of the Central Intelligence Agency. Similarly, because of the sensationalism which surrounded the Senate Select Committee's report on Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders, including Fidel Castro and the implications that the Mafia plot was a part of the authorized planning for the Bay of Pigs Operation, a thorough examination of the evidence was undertaken to determine if this allegation was supportable. It was not. The Mafia operation was run aside from, apart from, and independent of the formal anti-Castro program which was undertaken by CIA... allegations that the assassination plans being developed by the Mafia were a fundamental part of the official US Government program to overthrow Fidel Castro: There is no basis in fact for this charge...aside from considerable emphasis on the propaganda activity, there was only limited support for sabotage activities prior to the end of Eisenhower's administration. There was considerable concern over the necessary formalities of diplomacy in order that the United States not be involved in investigations by either the UN or the OAS for its anti-Castro program."<sup>[[1]](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/104-10301-10004.pdf)</sup></sup>
   
   The various pieces of evidence that seemed to implicate WH/4 in assassination plots against Castro or other of the Cuban leaders proved to be cold trails. The peripatetic Howard Hunt claimed, even prior to the Senate investigations, that after a visit to Havana in the spring of 1960, he prepared a report recommending among other things that the Agency should:  "Assassinate Castro before or coincident with the invasion (a task for Cuban patriots)... Barnes and Bissell read my report and said it would weigh in the final planning ... So far as I have been able to determine no coherent plan was ever developed within CIA to assassinate Castro, but it was the heart's desire of many exile groups."  In another instance, it appeared possible that an agent named [reacted] a Cuban exile, might have been in training to make an assassination attempt because it was reported that he  was taken to the [redacted] firing range where he was checked out in the use of the Special .38 Airweight semi-hammerless pistol; British Welrod pistol, single shot, a 9mm parabellum with silencer; carbine with folding stock; and a 7.65mm British Welrod with silencer. He is to be also checked out this week in the use of a sporting rifle with telescopic lens attachment. It was revealed subsequently that upon his reinfiltration into Havana, [redacted] had two principal sabotage missions. Further, "The cumulative impact of the foregoing and the attachments are the strong suggestions that organized crime elements had an ongoing operation to assassinate Castro before this Agency instituted Phase I and that Frank Sturgis was involved with these organized crime elements." The same was concluded for Sam Giancana.<sup>[[2]](https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/cia/18395.pdf)</sup></sup> Lastly, Operation Mongoose had strict limitations on sabotage: "No sabotage would be undertaken against food supplies, medical facilities, or directly against the population of Cuba as such."<sup>[[3]](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/6434690/National-Security-Archive-Doc-14-CIA-William.pdf#page=2)</sup></sup> Mongoose was also a Military operation, not CIA.
   
- Between 1958 & 1966, US helped Colombia deal with anti-narcotics efforts and counter-terrorism operations via train and advise efforts, under Plan LAZO (or LASO). US Survey teams recommended "Employing the [Colombian] armed forces in tasks intended to contribute to the economic development and social well-being of all Colombians, especially those subjected to guerrilla-bandit activity." Following this recommendation, the Lleras administration established rehabilitation commissions and thirty welfare teams to coordinate efforts to improve living conditions of those affected by violent activity. The rehabilitation commissions, which operated at a national level, tracked programs in designated zones, coordinated relief efforts, and improved access to credit for peasants displaced by the violence. The welfare teams, which operated at a local level, consisted of a doctor, a nurse, agrarian technicians, an engineer, a veterinarian, a home economist, and sometimes a public administrator. The teams acted as on-the-ground advisors for small, local projects, such as “[building] rural schools, mills, medical facilities, or ‘model’ farms.” In conjunction with the US country team, the military also developed plans to mend violence-ridden regions through social projects. First on an ad hoc basis, but then under the auspices of a presidential decree, the Colombian government developed road infrastructure, health care facilities, literacy programs, and access to potable water, among other activities, in the affected areas. Many Colombians were trained at the US Army School of the Americas (SOA), on civic action programs. By 1969, the Colombian government had built 138 road systems; provided medical treatment to 1.1 million civilians and dental care to nearly 900,000; and built forty-four wells, twenty-three health centers, and ninety-nine schools. Crime statistics during this period did decline, as did participation in criminal bands. A study of the impact of the civic action projects (code name Simpatico) conducted in the late 1960s by the Colombian and US governments did report a positive impact after exhaustive research in the affected areas.<sup>[[1]](https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&context=monographs)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://arsof-history.org/articles/pdf/v2n4_plan_lazo.pdf)</sup></sup> Conspiracy theorists have long-alleged that the US provided support to Los Pepes. However, an independent panel found that some intelligence provided to the Medellín Task Force may have incidentally ended up in their hands. by locals. CIA reported that the Colombian defense minister, Rafael Pardo, was "concerned that the police are providing intelligence to Los Pepes." A document titled, "Colombia: Extralegal Steps Against Escobar Possible," Agency analysts predicted that President Gaviria's "demand for an intensified effort to capture Escobar may lead some subordinates to rely more heavily on Los Pepes and on extralegal means."<sup>[[3]](https://ia601502.us.archive.org/0/items/lospepes-blue-ribbon-1/lospepes%20blue%20ribbon1.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://ia601409.us.archive.org/20/items/lospepes-blueribbon-2/lospepes%20blueribbon2.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.soc.mil/ARIS/books/pdf/ARIS_Colombia-BOOK.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://www.dia.mil/FOIA/FOIA-Electronic-Reading-Room/FileId/161969/)</sup></sup>

  The Government of Colombia developed "Plan Colombia" as an integrated strategy to meet the most pressing challenges confronting Colombia today -- promoting the peace process, combating the narcotics industry, reviving the Colombian economy, and strengthening the democratic pillars of Colombian society. Plan Colombia is a $7.5 billion program. President Pastrana has pledged $4 billion of Colombian resources and has called on the international community to provide the remaining $3.5 billion to assist this effort. In response to Plan Colombia, and in consultation with the Colombian Government, the United States is providing a $1.3 billion total U.S. interagency assistance package to Colombia. Adding to previously approved U.S. assistance to Colombia of over $330 million, the assistance package provided an additional $1.3 billion as an emergency supplemental. The total U.S. interagency assistance package will help Colombia address the broad range of complex and inter-related challenges it faces -- its efforts to fight the illicit drug trade, to increase the rule of law, to protect human rights, to expand economic development, to institute judicial reform, and to foster peace. Five Components of U.S. Assistance: 1) Support for Human Rights and Judicial Reform; 2) Expansion of Counter-Narcotics Operations into Southern Colombia; 3) Alternative Economic Development (such as assisting small farmers); 4) Increased drug Interdiction; 5) Assistance for the Colombian National Police. US efforts to support NGOs included: $5.8 million to the ICRC's Western Hemisphere operations for assistance to IDPs, with an additional $3 million for Colombia. The U.S. contributed another $4.7 million to UNHCR's general fund for the Western Hemisphere, a portion of which was used for institutional capacity building in Colombia. The success of US efforts in Plan Colombia are well documented.<sup>[[7]](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/wha/rls/fs/2001/1042.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://www.usglc.org/media/2017/04/USGLC-Plan-Columbia.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pdacn233.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://www.usaid.gov/document/gao-19-106-us-counternarcotics-assistance-colombia)</sup></sup> <sup>[[11]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-09-71.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[12]](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/RL32774.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- In 1958, the United States approached Fulgencio Batista of Cuba, to step down from power, both formally and with his long-standing friend in business, and for him to leave the Cuba scene for good, not support any elected person who'd merely be his puppet—in a bid to politically cease the hostilities between the "revolutionaries" who used terrorist tactics, against the Government and civilian populations. The US ceased its military aid to Batista, only supplying a limited number of radios. Prior to even 1958, the United States pressured, to some success, for the regime's military forces to respect human rights from a top-down level.<sup>[[1]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v06/d189)</sup></sup>


- In 1954, the CIA did not have a direct involvement in the coup in Guatemala. Further, many falsehoods have been spread about the justification and motives behind the support. Firstly, to settle who did the coup: Arbenz himself. He willingly stepped down, and handed over authority to the military—convinced of the arguments, after being notified of an ultimatum. The CIA did provided support to Castillo Armas' ragtag group. It was the successful psychological stress Arbenz and his officials faced, to which they caved—and had Arbenz step side. In the end, the Army betrayed the dictator. To quote at length from the CIA's own history on the episode, "In fact, Arbenz was deposed in a military coup, and neither the radio nor the air attacks had much to do with it." The study continues, "[redacted] ordered CAT pilots to attack military targets, countermanding previous orders to spare the Army while defection efforts were underway. Informing Dulles that "airpower could be decisive" in the ensuing days, he asked for additional fighter aircraft. That day, the Director met at the White House with Eisenhower and Holland. The latter strongly opposed sending planes to Castillo Armas, a move that would confirm US involvement and violate a Security Council resolution approved by the US. Eisenhower listened to these objection and then asked Dulles what chance the rebels would have without the aircraft. "About zero," the Director replied. "Suppose we supply the aircraft," the President asked. "What would be the chances then?" "about 20 percent." Dulles allowed. The president considered the answer realistic and gave the order to send to fighters. "If you had said 90 percent," he later told Dulles, "I'd have said no." Unknown to both men, the chances of success were substantially higher. The Guatemalan Army had given Arbenz its ultimatum before the all-out air offensive began. The aircraft [piloted by mercenaries] had little apparent effect on the situation in the field. Pilots found most of their WW2 surplus bombs failed to explode. Strafing produced the best results, but still failed to prevent or delay the Army buildup in Zacapa." Arbenz forces were winning militarily in practically every regard. CIA tried to have Armas change tactics, to minimise his group being eliminated in a single disastrous encounter. There was no need. Castillo Armas's troops had done their job. On 25 June, Arbenz had summoned his Cabinet, party officials, and union leaders to inform them that the Army was in revolt and that the only hope was to arm the populace. The following day no citizen army materialised. Diaz reneged on his promise. he was closest with Sanchez, monzon, and other military leaders plotting to seize power for themselves.

  The capitulation: Peurifoy met with the plotters on the afternoon of 27 June and learned that they planned to take power that night. They refused to deal with Castillo Armas, and asked Peuifoy to arrange a cease-fire. The Ambassador wanted Arbenz out. That evening at 8:00 Arbenz announced his resignation. He was turning over executive power to Colonel Diaz, he explained, "because i am certain he will guatantee democracy in Guatemala and all the social conquests of our people will be maintained." He expressed full confidence that, with the Army united behind Diaz, the rebels would be quickly routed. He had not "cracked." Diaz had persuaded him that an arrangement—a "mihailovich-Tito deal" as Peurifoy's words—could be reached that would allow the Army to co-opt and then discard Castillo Armas. By turning over power to the military, Arbenz hoped to salvage most of the gains of the 1944 revolution while defeating the rebellion and defusing US opposition. Moments later, Diaz took the microphone and proclaimed that he was seizing power in the name of the revolution, and that the Army would continue to fight against Armas. "We have been double-crossed," Peurifoy cabled Headquaters. Diaz, Sanchez, and Monzon formed a junta that retained in power most of the Arbenz Cabinet. When Peurifoy asked if they would negotiate with the rebels, the junta leaders "evaded all issues, praised their own anti-communism, slandered Castillo." They warned Fortuny and other communist leaders to seek asylum in foreign embassies. On the phone, "Colonel," he explained, "you are not convenient for American foreign policy." Diaz had to hear it from Peurifoy himself, and a few hours later the Ambassador confirmed the interpretation of American foreign policy. The Colonel grudgingly stepped aside." In the 11 days after Arbenz's resignation five successive juntas occupied the presidential palace." 

  Now, moving onto justifications and motives: That it was driven because of United Fruit lobbying (capitalism interests); was against the peasants, farmers, overall, the working class and engaged in assassinations. This narrative simply just doesn't align with reality—from the declassified record, "The US was concerned of Soviet penetration, as a breach head to launch attacks and other operations by the KGB against the US, as it became increasingly overt and covert in its influence operations in Guatemala." The study also refutes allegations the US was beholden to capitalist interests, "United Fruit's vast holdings and monopolies on communications and transit in Central America attracted the attention of lawyers in the Justice Department's antitrust division as early as 1919. In May 1951, they were preparing for court action to force United Fruit to divest itself of railroads and utilities in Guatemala when State Department intervened. In a National Security Council session, Department representatives argue that a legal attack on United Fruit's Guatemalan holdings would have 'serious foreign policy implications,' weakening the company at a time when the United States needed it. The action was suspended until the situation in Guatemala had improved. It is often asserted that the United States acted at the company's behest in Guatemala, but this incident suggests the opposite was true: the administration wanted to use United Fruit to contain Communism in the hemisphere. After the success of PBSUCCESS and United Fruit's use had ended, the State Department demanded the company grant higher wages, not just in Guatemala, but throughout the hemisphere. The Eisenhower administration proceeded with its suspended antitrust action, and in 1958 the company signed a consent decree divesting it of its holdings in railroads and marketing operations."

  The landmark study continues, "CIA supported the objectives of the Guatemalan land reform—the breakup of large estates into small freeholds—in some of its own programs. the Agency supported farm cooperative movements. In 1951, the Directorate of Plans undertook a global program to encourage small, independent landowners. In Guatemala, the program organised 15,000 peasants into 75 study groups, each of which formed a credit union to help its members buy land." On the question of assassination, the study finds, "Yet no covert action plan involving assassinations of Guatemalans was ever approved or implemented. The official objective of PBSUCCESS was to remove the Guatemalan Government covertly 'without bloodshed if possible.' Elimination lists were never finalized, assassination proposals remained controversial within the Agency, and it appears that no Guatemalans associated with Arbenz were assassinated. Both CIA and State Department officers were divided (and undecided) about using assassination. It would be over two decades after the events in Guatemala before DCI William Colby prohibited any CIA involvement in assassination and a subsequent Executive Order banned any US Government involvement in assassination."<sup>[[1]](https://ia601303.us.archive.org/6/items/CIA-Guatemala-Coup-Report/DOC_0000134974.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20180609064148/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000135796.pdf)</sup></sup> An American pilot sank the SS Springfjord, believed to have been smuggling weapons.

- In 1915, the United States undertook a military occupation of Haiti to preempt any European intervention, to establish order out of civil strife, and to stabilize Haitian finances. During the nineteen-year occupation, U.S. military and civilian officials, numbering less than 2,500 for the most part, supervised the collection of taxes and the disbursement of revenues, maintained public order, and initiated a program of public works. The Haitian government remained in place, but was subject to U.S. guidance. The Haitian people benefitted from the end of endemic political violence and from the construction of roads, bridges, and ports as well as from improved access to health care.

  In the early twentieth century, Haiti suffered from a tumultuous political life and from chronic financial mismanagement. Eighty percent of the Haitian budget went to debt service, and U.S. government officials were concerned that financial obligations to its own citizens might not be met. There was greater fear, also, that one among the warring European countries -- especially France or Germany -- might establish a position of influence in the country, leading to naval bases that could endanger access to the newly constructed Panama Canal. These concerns were heightened after the outbreak of World War I, when Haitian authority collapsed into bloody factional struggles in the summer of 1915; the Administration of Woodrow Wilson determined to take action. In July 1915, Admiral William B. Caperton, then embarked on the battleship Washington, was directed to land forces to establish order and assume responsibility for administering the customhouses.

  Once firmly established in the major population centers, U.S. officials quickly ensured the election by the Haitian National Assembly of an amenable president, Philippe Sudre Dartiguenave, who had served as the president of the Haitian Senate. As a result of continuing unrest, Admiral Caperton also established censorship and promulgated martial law. These emergency measures were not rescinded for over ten years. In another move to ensure an orderly government, the United States presented the Haitians with a treaty that permitted a U.S.-nominated official to collect taxes and make debt repayments and other disbursements. The treaty, (1) ratified by Haiti in November 1915 and by the U.S. Senate the following February, also created a constabulary (or gendarmerie) composed of native Haitians under American direction to serve both as Haiti's military and police force. The treaty was to remain in force for ten years and could be extended for another ten "if the purpose of this treaty has not been fully accomplished." In March 1917, the duration of the 1915 treaty was officially extended to twenty years.

  The Gendarmerie, whose name was changed in 1928 to the Garde d'Haiti, became an essential part of the administrative structure of the country. Officered at first by Americans -- largely enlisted marines -- who were paid both by the U.S. Marine Corps and by Haiti, the Gendarmerie, numbering 2,000-2,600 members, was deployed throughout the country and became largely responsible for maintaining law and order, settling disputes, and supporting public works projects. It also served as Haiti's military force. Gradually, U.S. officers were replaced by Haitians, a process that was accelerated after 1929. Historians, otherwise critical of the occupation, acknowledge that Haitians had more security in their persons and property than they had ever previously known and that the Gendarmerie, during the occupation, functioned as an effective and impartial agency. (After U.S. forces departed in 1934, Haitian officers would become much more involved in political activities.)

  Complaints of brutality against native Haitians led the U.S. Congress to conduct hearings on Haiti and the Dominican Republic in 1922. The special committee rejected the more serious charges and concluded that most of the abuses occurred during the effort to put down the caco insurrection in 1918-1919. The counterinsurgency effort resulted in the deaths, by some estimates, of over 2,000 cacos. The Committee found no abuse was ever sanctioned—and upon alleged, swift justice followed.

  The onset of the Great Depression and declining markets for Haitian products, especially coffee, produced economic hardships and contributed to increased unrest among a population long denied a political role. December 1929 riots in Les Cayes threatened to spread throughout the country. A detachment from the Marine Brigade in Port-au-Prince was sent to restore order, but a confrontation led to the deaths of at least 12 Haitians. Subsequent incidents were ended without loss of life, but the Hoover Administration was concerned that it might become involved in hostilities that U.S. public opinion would not support.

  In early 1930, President Hoover appointed a bipartisan commission headed by W. Cameron Forbes, formerly the Governor General of the Philippines, to investigate conditions in Haiti. After several weeks in the country during which testimony was taken from all sectors of the society, the commission submitted a report that argued that the United States could not relinquish its responsibilities for ensuring the financial stability of Haiti, but made several proposals for changes, especially the separation of civil and military responsibilities, increasing the number of Haitians in the government, and, in general, for less intervention in Haitian domestic affairs. In November, General Russell was replaced by a State Department official, Dana G. Munro, who was appointed Minister rather than High Commissioner. An Executive Agreement was negotiated in 1932 providing for the complete Haitianization of the Garde by October 1934 and for the withdrawal of the Marine Brigade, two years prior to the expiration of the extended 1915 Treaty. Washington was nonetheless determined to pull out of Haiti at an earlier date. Arrangements were made for the election of a temporary Haitian president and the subsequent holding of national elections in October 1930 that returned a strongly nationalistic majority. The complete Haitianization of the Garde was completed. President Franklin Roosevelt paid an official visit to Cap-Haitien in July 1934 and the last marines departed the following month. Nonetheless, a U.S. financial adviser would remain until 1941 to oversee payments on the Haitian debt.

  The U.S. occupation in large measure accomplished its goals of stabilizing Haitian finances. Security for investors was a key concern of the U.S. Government and to a large extent became the justification for the occupation once the potential threat of European intervention disappeared with the conclusion of World War I. A $16-million U.S. loan was negotiated in 1922 to consolidate Haiti's outstanding foreign debts. Efficient collection of duties and prompt, even advance, payment of debts owed to U.S. banks soon restored the country's financial standing. Eventually, some 60% of Haitian revenues were expended under U.S. supervision, the greatest percentage going to debt repayment. Some critics, including the Forbes Commission, argued that monies used for advance repayment of debts could have been more usefully allocated to domestic projects. There is consensus, however, that Haitian finances were honestly handled during the occupation and that steps were taken to insure that foreign interests did not take advantage of the country. In the 1920s, annual Haitian government revenues of $8-10 million were double that of the pre-occupation period; coffee production and small businesses grew significantly, but little progress was made in establishing a sound permanently economic base for the country.

  The United States undertook a major effort to provide access to modern health care to the mass of the Haitian population that in some cases had never come into contact with trained doctors and nurses. A National Public Health Service was created with a network of some 153 rural clinics and 11 hospitals supervised by U.S. Navy doctors, and efforts were made to provide basic medical instruction to the population. This effort was financed by the Haitian government at U.S. encouragement.<sup>[[1]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081233847&seq=9)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044084839125&seq=5)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/94-459.html)</sup></sup>

What was the crime? A perceived insult. "This wealth of information tied the plot directly to Libyan leader Mu'ammar Qhadafi."<sup>[[16]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4389688-The-Saudi-Assassination-Plot-How-It-Was-Thwarted.html)</sup></sup>

  The vast majority of the opposition to Qadhafi was not linked to militant extremism: legal professionals and civil society activists were among the first people to call for reform on the steps of the Benghazi courthouse in February 2011; and the National Transitional Council (NTC) and its Executive Office were led by Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, a former Minister under Qadhafi, and Mahmoud Jibril, a reformer who had worked with Saif al-Islam Qadhafi. NTC members were drawn from across Libya and included representatives of Libya’s minority groups and women. The armed opposition included many professional military officers who had defected from Qadhafi in protest at his response to the peaceful demonstrations.

  The UK, NATO and the UN acknowledged the security risk posed by weapons abandoned by the Qadhafi regime and took action to track and secure them. In 2011 and 2012, the UK supported a US-led project to secure man-portable surface-to-air missiles (MANPADS) within Libya. Joint Libyan, American and French teams inspected more than 1,600 bunkers and identified, secured, disabled or confirmed as destroyed around 5,000 MANPADS components and complete systems. The UK also provided £1.4m and civilian experts to support the inspection of ammunition storage areas. In 2013 and 2014, the UK led international efforts to focus specifically on the issue of arms and ammunition. As part of a cross-Government Security, Justice and Defence (SJD) programme, UK advisers supported and facilitated local council and militia agreements to build and secure five temporary storage facilities.<sup>[[17]](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/834/834.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Some conspiracy theorists also allege the US provided weapons to rebels in Libya against the evil terror regime. As evidence, they twist the facts surrounding US v. Turi—by suggesting he was working on behalf of the US Government to supply arms—and that the evidence of this, was that the Government dropped the case during discovery proceedings—to protect the "truth." However, this is nothing more than fantasy via either pure ignorance to the facts, or deliberate omission. Since 2008, Defendant Turi “has been a State Department-registered broker of ‘defense articles’” pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act (“AECA”), 22 U.S.C. § 2778. Doc. 12 at 2.1 Turi and his company, Defendant Turi Defense Group, Inc., “have supplied, and provided logistical support for the supply of, defense articles in furtherance of U.S. Government policy in Iraq and Afghanistan, among other places.” The indictment alleges that in early 2011, Defendants submitted two “Letter[s] of Prior Approval” to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”) requesting approval from the State Department for Defendants to broker weapons from Eastern Europe to the National Transitional Council (“NTC”) of Libya. Doc. 3 at 8-9. These requests for prior approval were denied on March 22, 2011. Id. at 9. Defendants allegedly attempted to amend their requests, but their amended request was denied in May 2011.

  The indictment alleges that Defendants also submitted a request for prior approval to broker the same weapons to the Government of Qatar. Id. This request was approved in a letter from the DDTC dated May 5, 2011. Although Defendants sought approval to broker weapons to Qatar, the indictment alleges that the intended end user of the weapons was the NTC in Libya.  The indictment also alleges that Defendants, seeking a possible alternate to Qatar, submitted another request for prior approval to broker the same weapons to the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), but again intended the end user to be the NTC in Libya. Defendants were indicted on four counts in February 2014. See Doc. 3. Counts one and three allege violations of 22 U.S.C. § 2778(c) and 22 C.F.R. §§ 126.1, 127.2, and 127.3. Counts two and four allege violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3). Section 2778(c) provides that any person “who willfully, in a registration or license application or required report, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein."

  The Court agreed with the Government on the licence issue. The Court also rejected the evidence proffered by the defense, such as news articles, etc. by carefully reading what they actually say v the headline sensationalism. Aka: contemplating vs actual transfer.<sup>[[18]](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-azd-2_14-cr-00191/pdf/USCOURTS-azd-2_14-cr-00191-0.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[19]](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-azd-2_14-cr-00191/pdf/USCOURTS-azd-2_14-cr-00191-3.pdf)</sup></sup> However, defense still tried to use discovery proceedings to obtain that information. From the Government's motion to dismiss, "The government apprised the Court of the results of its search for such documents through a motion under Section 4 of the Classified Information Procedures Act, 18 U.S.C. App. 3 § 4. Subsequently, the Government apprised counsel for Defendant Turi of the results in a classified document. During the hearing, the Court noted that, by its October 22, 2014 Order, it intended to order the disclosure of a document “if it relates to an effort to arm rebels, something that actually occurred, then it should be disclosed,” but it also pointed out that “there is a difference between actively contemplating and doing it.” (RT 8/11/15 at 7, 9). On October 2, 2015, the Court denied the Defendants’ motion and again reiterated that “Category 2 does not call for documents relating to ‘possible efforts’ or ‘contemplated efforts’ to arm Libyan rebels.” Defendants again filed a motion seeking to compel additional information. On March 25, 2016, the Court issued an order reversing its prior rulings and ordered more extensive discovery. As a result, government counsel consulted various government entities in accordance with the order. While the latest discovery order was pending, Defendants negotiated with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ("DDTC").1 Defendants and DDTC have now reached an administrative settlement that is memorialized in a signed consent agreement between DDTC and the Defendants (Attached as sealed Exhibit A). In light of the Court’s discovery rulings, the administrative resolution between DDTC and the defendant, and other factors, the government seeks leave of the Court to dismiss the criminal matter with prejudice pursuant to Rule 48(a). While the parties disagree on the facts of this case and the defendants' deny any criminal conduct, the defendants' acknowledge that the charges obtained in this case were based in fact."<sup>[[20]](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000157-90b1-d51f-adf7-bef1bbc80002)</sup></sup>

- Somalia, 1992-1994. In the early 1960s the United States established a presence, including communications listening posts, in the northern part of Ethiopia and backed the traditional regime of Emperor Haile Selassie. Haile Selassie attempted to modernise the country through a series of political and social reforms, including the introduction of the 1931 constitution, its first written constitution, and the abolition of slavery. The Soviets, on the other hand, replaced the weakened Italian influence in neighboring Somalia and supported the authoritarian regime of Somali strongman Mohammed Siad Barre, who took power in 1969. After Siad Barre precipitated a disastrous war against Ethiopia over the status of the Ogaden region in 1977, the situation in Somalia grew worse. Western aid dried up, and Barre was forced to grow ever more repressive to maintain his grip on power. He began a policy of systematic kidnapping and murder against rival clan leaders that increased in ferocity over time. Finally, antigovernment riots led to overreaction on the part of Siad Barre’s bodyguards, who killed 65 civilians and seriously injured over 300 in 1990. His legitimacy in shambles, the army and the people turned against him in a prolonged series of riots, political maneuvers, and violence. Siad Barre was forced to flee the country in January 1991 with some of his closest supporters. Almost immediately, a resurgence of clan violence led to the virtual destruction of any central government and to economic chaos. As Somalia lapsed into sectarian and ethnic warfare, regional warlords drew upon clan loyalty to establish independent power bases. This situation led to a struggle over food supplies with each clan raiding the storehouses and depots of the others. Coupled with a drought, these actions brought famine to hundreds of thousands of the nation’s poor. Although private and volunteer relief organizations established refugee camps to try to prevent widespread deaths from starvation, they could not handle the massive amounts of aid and the requisite security structure that were needed. International relief organizations paid protection money to the warlords as they tried to distribute what donated food supplies did arrive. More often than not, such supplies never reached the hands of those who needed them but instead were confiscated by the warlords who distributed or sold them to enhance their own power and prestige. The general misery was only compounded by the brutality of the Somali clans toward their rivals and the sporadic outbreaks of actual fighting. The most visible elements of the suffering—pictures of starving, fly-covered children—appeared nightly on American television screens. The administration of President George H. W. Bush felt it could not ignore the situation, despite the obvious risks of intervening in a country still at war with itself.

  The United Nations reacted to the worsening plight of Somalia in early 1992. On 24 April it approved Resolution 751, which authorized humanitarian relief operations in the stricken country and established the United Nations Operations in Somalia, or UNOSOM. Almost immediately, a small group of peacekeepers deployed to the country and tried to sort out the confusing array of clans, private armies, and relief organizations, all competing over the distribution of food relief supplies. While some progress was made in the major cities, it was apparent that significant amounts of the supplies destined for the interior were being hijacked by the armies of the clans or by the relief organizations’ security guards, hired by the UN and the relief agencies to guard the convoys of food. Since UN and private volunteer organizations were generally prohibited from hiring armed security forces, they instead hired local tribesmen as technical assistants—hence the nickname “technicals.” The technicals were armed bodyguards, often driving pick-up trucks or land cruisers with machine guns or other heavy weapons mounted. In response to the worsening famine, the United States decided to assist the relief efforts by airlifting food from nearby Kenya to remote airfields in the interior of Somalia for distribution, thus bypassing congested ports and reducing the need to send out easily looted convoys. For this purpose, the United States launched Operation PROVIDE RELIEF on 15 August 1992. The actual ground distribution continued to be accomplished by the international relief organizations already established in the country. PROVIDE RELIEF was thus a limited attempt to use U.S. expertise in logistics to help the relief effort without engaging American military forces on the ground. Problems of distribution within the country continued to hamper the relief effort. In the countryside, lawless gangs seized relief supplies and used them to buy local loyalties while letting thousands starve. In the cities, the warring political factions, supported by their private armies, amassed food stockpiles as bargaining chips and signs of their power. These rival entities, often barely controlled by their clan leaders, terrorized the international organizations, stealing food and killing whoever did not pay protection money. Because of the increasingly chaotic situation on the ground, as a security measure U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers accompanied many of the relief flights. That involvement was not long in coming. Unable to explain to the world why the United States, the “sole remaining superpower” and leader of the “new world order,” was not able to stop the starvation, President Bush ordered U.S. forces to deploy to Somalia. Their mission was to ensure that relief supplies reached the people who needed them and thus to “break the cycle” of starvation and save lives.

  The operation, RESTORE HOPE, began on 8 December 1992 under the direction of a Unified Task Force, or UNITAF. Like all modern humanitarian operations, it was a joint, combined, and interagency effort. The role of the U.S. State Department was critical. Once Ambassador Robert B. Oakley was appointed as President Bush’s special envoy to Somalia, he and General Johnston moved quickly to establish a close working relationship. Although the United Nations continued to play an important part in the politics within the country, especially in the delicate negotiations between rival Somali factions, its role was soon overshadowed by U.S. military and diplomatic power. Security Council Resolution 794, passed on 3 December, endorsed the U.S.-led operation and gave it its international flavor and legitimacy, but the UN simply lacked the logistics, command and control, or intelligence capabilities to undertake such a complex mission. Marine Corps and Navy special operations elements moved into Somalia in the early morning hours of 9 December, with the first 1,300 marines coming in by helicopter directly to Mogadishu airport. Emerging from the ocean surf in the predawn hours, the Navy Seals were immediately hit with the blazing lights of forewarned media crews. Luckily, the diplomatic groundwork had been laid for U.S. troops to arrive with no Somali resistance. Thereafter, Somali warlords quickly agreed to cooperate with each other (at least for a time) and work with the U.S. troops to establish a relatively benign and secure environment. 

  The main challenge to the smooth flow of relief supplies continued to be the rivalry between feuding warlords, particularly between the forces of General Muhammed Farah Aideed of the Habr Gidr subclan and Ali Mahdi Mohamed of the Abgal subclan in Mogadishu. Aideed, previously a general in dictator Siad Barre’s army and a former ambassador to India, now headed the Somali National Alliance (SNA) with pretensions to ruling the entire country. His opponent, Ali Mahdi, was a former businessman and farmer with little military experience and only an ad hoc militia. Their feud had led to open conflict from November 1991 to February 1992 and only added to the tragedy of Somalia by killing thousands of innocent Mogadishu citizens. Backed by overwhelming U.S. and allied power, Ambassador Oakley effectively established a cease-fire between the two forces as a precondition to establishing a military and relief presence in the interior of the country. However, it was not in the UN charter, nor in the U.S. mission guidance, to disarm or attack either faction. Ostensibly, the UNITAF forces were neutral and there only to ensure that relief supplies flowed. They achieved this mission by late December, as the port and the airport reopened and relief supplies began moving quickly ashore. Over 40,000 tons of grain were off-loaded by the end of December along with 6,668 vehicles and 96 helicopters for the military forces. While Mogadishu maintained an uneasy calm, UNITAF forces began to move into the countryside. To aid in coordination, the southern part of the country, the area most marked by drought and famine, was divided into nine humanitarian relief sectors (HRS).

  On the whole, the relief mission proceeded well, with few incidents of violence from February to May 1993. It seemed that life was assuming some measure of normalcy. Markets reopened, travel became more common, and there was even some hope of restarting a Somali national police force with promising initial results. However, clan rivalry and U.S. reluctance to engage in long-term “nation-building” operations soon doomed the effort. Troops conducted mounted and dismounted patrols throughout the cities in their sectors with occasional brushes with bandits and unruly crowds. Carefully written UNITAF Rules of Engagement (ROE) limited their responses by reminding the soldiers that this was not a wartime environment, that all persons were to be treated with dignity and respect, and that only the minimum force necessary for the mission was authorized. These ROE did not in any way, however, interfere with the right to defend oneself or one’s unit. In one instance a noncommissioned officer shot and killed a young Somali who ran up to his vehicle carrying a small box that the sergeant believed might be a bomb. Despite the tragic nature of the event, charges against the soldier were dismissed under legitimate self-defense grounds. However, in another instance, a sergeant shot and killed an individual who had stolen his sunglasses. His claim of self-defense was rejected, and he was convicted at a general court-martial. On the whole, however, U.S. Army soldiers behaved with care and restraint. By April the situation had stabilized enough that the U.S. administration determined that it was time to turn the mission over to the United Nations entirely. Despite some setbacks and incidents, Operation RESTORE HOPE succeeded in its goal of bringing an end to mass starvation. The heavily armed UNITAF units quickly established security in their sectors, and an uneasy truce kept the peace between the factions. There were some warning signs on the horizon, however, as UN diplomats began to press for a more active role of the military in confiscating weapons and in forcing some kind of political settlement. Soon after the United States turned over the mission completely to the United Nations in May, the situation began to unravel.

  While U.S. and allied forces maintained the peace in Somalia, U.S. leaders were working hard to push the United Nations into establishing a new mission in Somalia to take over the majority of the responsibilities for running the relief effort while allowing the United States to reduce the size of its committed forces and handle only limited aspects of security and logistics. On 26 March 1993, the United Nations passed Resolution 814 which considerably broadened its mandate to intervene in another country’s affairs. The UN was now intervening militarily in a peacemaking role under Chapter VII of its charter. The more frequently used Chapter VI addressed only the deployment of peace-keeping troops to reinforce a previously agreed upon settlement between warring parties. But Chapter VII dealt with peace enforcement and not merely peacekeeping. The resolution underlined the charters of the first UNOSOM mission and Operation RESTORE HOPE and that of the new mission, UNOSOM II. In support of UNOSOM II, the United States provided a substantial logistics structure (consisting of about 2,600 troops) and a small special operations element. 

  It quickly became apparent that Aideed had little respect for the new organization, the UN, or Admiral Howe. On 5 June 1993, his Somalia National Alliance forces ambushed and killed 24 Pakistani soldiers assigned to UNOSOM II. Another 44 were wounded. The following day, the United Nations Security Council approved Resolution 837 adopting a more aggressive military stance toward Aideed and asking member states for more troops and equipment. It also directed UNOSOM II to apprehend those responsible for the ambush. In Mogadishu, Pakistani and Italian forces conducted heavy armored patrols throughout the city, concentrating on the areas near the ambush site. On 17 June, after being advised by a UN panel of jurists that Aideed and his SNA were behind the ambush of the Pakistanis, Admiral Howe issued a warrant for Aideed’s arrest and authorized a $25,000 reward. Skirmishing between UN and U.S. elements and Aideed’s Habr Gidr subclan continued, and on 12 July, the American QRF attacked a major Aideed compound with helicopter gunships. After the raid, a hostile crowd near the compound killed four western journalists covering the action, displaying their bodies for the world to see. Immediately, UNOSOM II Force Command focused its intelligence and operational capability on locating, capturing, and arresting Aideed and any of his supporters whom it deemed responsible for the attacks of June and July. As the military situation worsened, UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked the new U.S. administration of President William J. Clinton to assist him in capturing Aideed. On 22 August 1993, Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin, directed the deployment of a joint special operations task force (JSOTF) to Somalia in response to attacks made by Aideed supporters upon American and UNOSOM. The JSOTF, named Task Force Ranger, had the mission of capturing Aideed and his key lieutenants and turning them over to UNOSOM II forces.

  In one of the most violent and costly incidents, on 8 September U.S. and Pakistani soldiers were clearing roadblocks near a site known as the Cigarette Factory when they were attacked by Somali militia. It took extensive fires from ground and aviation units to suppress the enemy fire. Later that same day, near an abandoned allied checkpoint, the same clearing element was again attacked by militiamen. Six UNOSOM II soldiers were injured. On 16 and 21 September two roadblock-clearing teams were attacked on 21 October Road. The team attacked on 21 September was a Pakistani element, and it lost an armored personnel carrier and suffered nine casualties, including two killed. On 25 September a U.S. Black Hawk helicopter was shot down and three soldiers killed. The battles of 3–4 October were a watershed in U.S. involvement in Somalia. The situation required constant innovation and rapid decisions from all the troops and commanders involved, under conditions that did not allow the American soldiers to take advantage of their great technological superiority. Experience, common sense, group cohesion, and superior tactical training were the virtues that made survival in the new environment possible as the decision-makers in Washington grappled with what to do next. In the aftermath of the 3–4 October battle, U.S. military presence in Somalia increased significantly, although temporarily. However, it soon became clear that the Clinton administration was focused on using those forces to facilitate the withdrawal of U.S. troops rather than use them to punish Aideed. General Montgomery had clear guidance: protect the force, protect the UN, and bring the force out with a minimum of casualties. In a national security policy review session held in the White House on 6 October, the president directed the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral David G. Jeremiah, to stop all actions by U.S. forces against Aideed except those required in self-defense. He also reappointed Ambassador Oakley as special envoy to Somalia in an attempt to broker a peace settlement and then announced that all U.S. forces would withdraw from Somalia no later than 31 March 1994.

  All attempts to reconcile the Somali factions had proven futile, and the international community gradually lost its patience with the total lack of political results. Operation UNITED SHIELD, the final UN withdrawal from Somalia, was completed on 3 March 1995. The United States, as part of the international community, had made major contributions to the Somalia humanitarian operations for over two years. Starvation had been stopped and hundreds of thousands of lives saved. The U.S. had accomplished much in the initial stages of the operation, but the political situation had unraveled even as the food supplies increased, allowing Somalia to slide backwards into disorder and anarchy.<sup>[[1]](https://history.army.mil/html/documents/somalia/SomaliaAAR.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/History/Monographs/Somalia.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1994, the US led diplomatic and humanitarian efforts against the Rwandan genocide.<sup>[[1]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Other/95-A-0894_DoD_Support_for_Humanitarian_Efforts_in_Rwanda.pdf)</sup></sup> In 1961, Rwandans voted to become a republic, and in July 1962 Belgium split the territory of Ruanda-Urundi into the independent nations of Rwanda and Burundi. Although Hutus gained political power in Rwanda, Tutsis still controlled the military government of Burundi. Grégoire Kayibanda, founder of the Hutu Emancipation Movement Party, became the first elected President of an independent Rwanda. The establishment of political, economic, and social policies favorable to Hutus and sporadic violence against Tutsis led many Tutsis to leave Rwanda for neighboring Burundi and Uganda. In December 1963, Tutsi exiles invaded Rwanda from Burundi, which led to more retaliatory violence against Tutsis remaining in Rwanda. Kayibanda’s government persisted until 1973, when a military coup led by Juvénal Habyarimana seized power and instituted a Hutu-dominated single-party military dictatorship.

  In 1987, Tutsi refugees in Uganda Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) with other Tutsi refugees who had fought in Yoweri Museveni’s Ugandan rebel army during the 1980s Ugandan Bush War. On October 1, 1990 the RPF launched an invasion of Rwanda from Uganda, starting the Rwandan Civil War. After Rwigyema was killed, within the first few days of the invasion, Paul Kagame returned from military schooling in the United States and took command of the RPF. Following several years of guerilla warfare and military stalemate between the Rwandan government and the RPF, the warring factions agreed to the Arusha Accords in August 1993. This cease-fire agreement intended to integrate the RPF into the Rwandan political system and military and allow refugees to return to Rwanda. Despite the peace efforts, on April 6, 1994 an airplane carrying Rwandan president Juvénal Habyarimana and Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira was shot down near Kigali International Airport. The RPF and Rwandan government blamed each other for the assassination, and in response Hutu extremists in the Rwandan military and Hutu militias began killing Tutsis and moderate Hutus in retaliation. An estimated 500,000 and possibly up to 1 million people were murdered in the approximately 100-day genocide.

  In October 1993, the United Nations Security Council authorized UNAMIR (United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda) to assist with implementing the Arusha Accords. However, due to delays assembling the international peacekeeping force and continuing disagreements between the RPF and Rwandan government, UNAMIR fell victim to the outbreak of violence after the death of President Habyarimana. As instability increased and hostilities worsened, most of UNAMIR’s 2,500 personnel withdrew from Rwanda. In May 1994, the UN Security Council authorized UNAMIR II to increase the size of the peacekeeping force in Rwanda. However, further delays in assembling the required international military forces and the rapid nature of the violence meant that UNAMIR II failed to stop the genocide. The most significant international force deployment involved the French, who in June 1994 set up a “humanitarian safe zone” in southwestern Rwanda along the border with Zaire and Burundi. However, this was controversial due to prior French support of the Habyarimana government.

  The role of the United States in responding the Rwandan genocide focused primarily on humanitarian aid. The massacre of Tutsi and subsequent military offensive by the RPF created a massive humanitarian and refugee crisis. The Clinton Administration opposed direct military intervention and large-scale UNAMIR deployment in Kigali, but expressed support for humanitarian assistance and a UN peacekeeping force to protect refugees in border areas. In April 1994, the U.S. called for an immediate cease-fire and renewed negotiations per the Arusha Accords. At a July 22, 1994 press conference, President Clinton requested Congress provide $320 million in emergency relief for Rwandan refugees and announced measures for humanitarian relief and supply airlifts. Overall, the U.S. shipped 100,000 metric tons of food and earmarked $250 million towards humanitarian relief efforts. After the RPF took control of Rwanda and ended the genocide, the U.S. government pledged to work with the UN to set up a war crimes tribunal and human rights monitoring, encourage national reconciliation with the new government of Rwanda, and create conditions for refugees to return.<sup>[[3]](https://clinton.presidentiallibraries.us/rwanda)</sup></sup>

- 1986 - Operation El Dorado Canyon launched lawful airstrikes against Libya, in response to a series of terrorist attacks ordered and supported by Libyan warlord and dictator, Gaddafi. Studies have found this highly successful raid resulted in a decline in Libyan-backed international terrorism. Admiral Kelso imposed strict rules of engagement to avoid or reduce the possibility of civilian casualties in the congested urban area of Tripoli, while inflicting as much damage as possible on the targets . He insisted that each airplane should have positive identification of its assigned target on multiple systems and abort its attack if weapon-guidance or navigation systems were not fully functional.<sup>[[1]](https://media.defense.gov/2012/Aug/23/2001330097/-1/-1/0/Op%20El%20Dorado%20Canyon.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10576109708436039?journalCode=uter20)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1722&context=jil)</sup></sup>

- Angolan civil war, 1975. The officer's revolt in Lisbon in April 1974 provided the catalyst for the political upheavals in Angola that ultimately resulted in civil war and foreign intervention. In the immediate aftermath of the Portuguese coup, Moscow took a wait-and-see attitude toward Angola while carefully monitoring events there. The first concrete Soviet involvement following the coup was the shipment of small arms to Neto's faction in the latter part of 1974. This aid was in part designed to counteract Peking's increasing material support for the MPLA's chief rival for power, the FNLA. The Angolan civil war may be said to have begun in March 1975. That month saw the first major outbreak of hostilities between competing Angolan factions since the signing of the Alvor Accord. It was also in March that the Soviet Union first became involved in the Angolan conflict in a major way by sending substantial amounts of military aid to the faction it favored. Surrounding African nations asked the US to help prevent Moscow imposing a government of its own choice on Africans. Only on July 17, US decided to make its first major investment in Angola. The first American plane carrying arms for the FNLA arrived in Zaire on July 29, and a single shipload of military supplies departed August 28, more than five months after the Soviets began sending substantial quantities of arms by sea and air. Moscow would undoubtedly have preferred to avoid such large-scale, overt involvement before November 11, the date the Portuguese had set for Angolan independence. The Soviets had undoubtedly hoped that by November 11 the MPLA would be able to declare itself the government of Angola, and request Soviet aid on an official state-to-state basis. But the November escalation shows the lengths to which the Soviets were willing to go and the risks they were willing to run to achieve their basic objective—imposition of the MPLA as the sole ruling group in Angola. As at several other stages in the crisis, Moscow was not confronted by a simple choice between military victory or defeat for its clients. A third option, which was preferred by the US, China and many African states, was still available—a coalition government representing all three liberation movements.

  US assistance to the anti-MPLA forces was limited in scope and purpose, and did not provide a major provocation for the Soviet-Cuban escalation. In all, the US during 1975 supplied 2,800 tons of military equipment valued at $31.7 million to the anti-MPLA forces, compared to the 20,000 tons valued at approximately $200 million supplied to the MPLA by Moscow and Havana. The purpose of US objectives were to create a stalemate on the battlefield, to provide leverage for diplomatic efforts to end all foreign intervention, and to seek a peaceful solution within the framework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Beginning in October, US officials communicated these objectives to Moscow so that US intentions and actions would not be misread. In sum, the magnitude and character of the Soviet-Cuban intervention argue against the thesis that it was primarily a response to the involvement of other outside powers. The flow of weapons, advisors, and troops was disproportionate to the direct military support provided to anti-MPLA forces by Zaire and South Africa and to the indirect military assistance rendered by China and the US. Moscow and Havana brought overwhelming force to bear on their primary objective—the defeat of the FNLA-UNITA coalition and the creation of a government in Angola beholden to the Soviet Union.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000518406.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Overtime, Angolans started to view the Cubans and Soviets as "the new colonialists." Angolans frequently criticize the Cubans for being arrogant, for ignoring African sensibilities, and for monopolizing with the Soviets the few remaining luxuries in the country, where Cubans enjoy conspicuously high standards of living while Angolans experience severe shortages of food and other basic necessities. Furthermore, the Cubans and the Soviets are also being faulted for lack of economic progress and the failure to eliminate insurgency. The presence of Cuban troops in Angola, supporting the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and Angolan President Agostinho Neto, complicated efforts by the MPLA and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to end the civil war in the country. Their presence also created concerns that Cuban troops would be introduced into the conflicts in Namibia and Rhodesia. In early 1977, Carter instructed Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to explore ways to improve relations with Angola and end the civil war. The issue of Cuban troops and the need to decrease their presence dominated the discussions. The administration decided upon a two-pronged approach: direct talks with the Angolans to convince them to tell the Cubans to leave and a covert propaganda operation highlighting the negative impact of Cuban presence on both Cuban and Angolan societies.<sup>[[2]](https://static.history.state.gov/frus/frus1977-80v16/pdf/frus1977-80v16.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Ghana gained its independence under Kwame Nkrumah in 1957. The Soviet clandestine apparatus quickly recognized in Nkrumah's vanity and instability a vulnerable target. What happened in the next few years is a textbook example of how to build a wooden horse and capture a continent. Using conventional diplomacy and propaganda, the Soviets inflated Nkrumah as a world figure, the great leader of Africa. Flattery coupled with lavish servings of cash and arms won his confidence. Playing on this confidence, the Soviets went straight for the keys of power. They secured Nkrumah's invitation to come in and reorganize his intelligence and security services. In so doing they saw to it that there was a profusion of overlapping security organizations which opened the whole apparatus to Soviet manipulation. Twenty-two Russian intelligence officers turned up in key Chanaian intelligence jobs. The Soviets also awarded Ghanaian intelligence officers "intelligence scholarships" in the USSR. With this kind of leverage they were in a position to pursue their wider objective -one which went far beyond the borders of Ghana. What they were really shooting for was the establishment of strong Soviet influence in a number of African states under the appealing cover of Ghana's radical African nationalism. All this and more we have learned from the regime which has run Ghana since Nkrumah's happy fall from office last February.

  The Soviets were not the only Communists meddling in Ghana. The new government threw out three Chinese intelligence officers and 13 Chinese guerrilla warfare instructors. The latter were responsible for training Africans of various nationalities at secret camps, a program begun by the Russians. The Russians had not been a success, however; they drank too much and one of them got the camp cook plastered in order to seduce his wife. So the Chinese were called in. The Chinese did much better. Quoting inexorably from Chairman Mao, they trained several hundred "freedom fighters" from such countries as Nigeria and the Ivory Coast. They taught them how to make crude explosives and fuses under field conditions, how to set an ambush, how to handle small arms, communications, and—inevitably— how to "raise the ideological level," Chinese for political indoctrination. Then there were the East Germans; they apparently concentrated on espionage training. Two skilled intelligence officers were sent to Ghana to train Ghanaian agents targeted against neighboring African states. Their students became very proficient, but somehow they seemed to be doing more work against the West German embassy than against the African ones.

  In 1966, the NLC, a body of a few military and police officers, overthrew President of Ghana, Nkrumah's corrupt and authoritarian regime. It established a number of committees by civilian specialists to provide guidance and expertise on political affairs and governance, and pledged (and kept its promise) to stay in power only for 2-3 years after rooting out the corruption and deep Soviet, Chinese and East German intelligence service penetration. The US had no involvement in this coup, but did learn of plotting beforehand. All in all, the new government expelled 1,100 Russians, 430 Chinese, and smaller numbers from the East European countries. Had their activities been permitted to go on much longer, Nkrumah's position would have been impregnable. He would not, however, have been the man in charge, no matter what he himself believed. And Ghanaian diplomacy, propaganda, and subversion would have carried the Soviet and Chinese intelligence services piggy-back across Africa.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79T00826A003200100001-9.pdf#page=4)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201017165629/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol11no3/pdf/v11i3a01p.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80B01676R000400130013-2.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- Between 1960 and 1968, the US Government engaged in overt and covert political aid, in building a stable, moderate Government in the Congo, through various Congolese administrations. Important context:  At this point, the Congo had a population of 14 million divided into over 200 ethnic groups and four major tribes, with fewer than 20 Congolese college graduates in the entire country, led by a government heavily dependent on the former Belgian colonialists to maintain infrastructure, services, and security, with an army that was poorly trained, inadequately equipped, and badly led, and a fractured political structure consisting of four semi-autonomous regions and a weak and factious “central” government in the capital of Leopoldville (Kinshasa today). The US ambassador in the early 1960s, Clare Timberlake, sympathized with the Agency officers he worked with: “Every time I look at this truly discouraging mess, I shudder over the painfully slow, frustrating and costly job ahead for the UN and US if the Congo is to really be helped. On the other hand, we can’t let go of this bull’s tail." These covert activities included: Support to labor unions and student groups, UN positions to favour the Government, Parliamentary manoeuvring advice, aid to leftist groups, peaceful demonstrations, etc. Once these activities concluded upon success, the CIA then engaged in a paramilitary activity to support the Government in defeating Chinese/Cuban/Russian-backed terrorists. These groups engaged in mass killings, rape, and torture. CIA provided key support to the rescue effort with the Congolese Government, and the Red Cross, to save 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by these terrorists. The terrorists executed a number of these innocent people. CIA also provided direct tactical support to UN peacekeeper operations. 

  It should be noted that Belgium, while not directly involved in Lumumba's death, did play a role in his arrest. "The Belgium Parliamentary inquiry concluded that Belgium wanted Lumumba arrested and, not being particularly concerned with his physical well-being, took no action to prevent his death even though it knew he probably would be killed. The report specifically denied that the Belgian government ordered Lumumba’s murder but that Belgian advisers to Lumumba’s enemies assisted in making it happen."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/CIAs-Covert-Ops-Congo.pdf)</sup></sup> Some pundits will try use quotes from the Church Committee to suggest CIA involvement. Key quotes by the Church committee often ignored, all to conveniently by conspiracy theorists: "There is, however, no evidence of United States involvement in bringing about the death of Lumumba at the hands of Congolese authorities in Katanga."<sup>[[2]](https://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/ir/pdf/ChurchIR_3A_Congo.pdf#page=52)</sup></sup> When lethal substances were sent to CIA's Congo station, "there is no evidence that these instruments of assassination were actually used against Lumumba."<sup>[[3]](https://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/ir/pdf/ChurchIR_3A_Congo.pdf#page=13)</sup></sup> To the general aid offered to the Congolese Government, "there is no evidence that aid was ever provided for the specific purpose of assassination."<sup>[[4]](https://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/ir/pdf/ChurchIR_3A_Congo.pdf#page=18)</sup></sup> Another, "There is, however, no suggestion of a connection between the assassination plot and the events which actually led to Lumumba's death."<sup>[[5]](https://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/ir/pdf/ChurchIR_3A_Congo.pdf#page=19)</sup></sup> As the Rockefeller Commission also found, "No evidence was found that the CIA participated in that killing, although there is evidence that prior to Lumumba's death some CIA personnel and others discussed the possibility of undertaking a plan to assassinate Lumumba."<sup>[[6]](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf#page=8)</sup></sup> To keep things into perspective: Executive Order 11905 was signed on Feb 18, 1976. It was the first EO to issue a ban on assassination. Lumumba's death came in 17 Jan, 1961.

- Conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists claim the US did nothing, or worse, supported apartheid in South Africa. However, the exact opposite was true: US pressured the government with strong public condemnations, diplomatic pressures, private citizens with influence in the country, and engaged in an extensive military aid embargo, prior to the UN mandate—and more extensive.<sup>[[1]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31210024734038&view=1up&seq=1)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951002942901y&view=1up&seq=3)</sup></sup>

- ## Yugoslav Wars
Due to the overlap and proximity of these conflicts, I've addressed them in a narrative format, quoting exclusively from Historians, legal scholars and independent investigations.

Kosovo War (1998–1999) Overview 

- With Tito's death in 1980, the relative calm that had pervaded Yugoslavia came to an abrupt end as ethnic and nationalist differences flared up yet again. Initially, Kosovar Albanians rioted in 1981 over poor living, economic, and educational conditions. Pristina University became a "hotbed of Albanian nationalism," and another mass exodus of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo followed anti-Serb riots by the Albanian population. In response, Serbian anger continued to increase as Serbs now saw themselves as the aggrieved, disadvantaged party. By 1987, swelling Serbian resentment led to massive protest marches and rallies, paving the way for Slobodan Milosevic,106 who surged to power on a platform of radical Serb nationalism. Milosevic's first guarantee was that he would protect ethnic Serbs from abuse in Kosovo. He then had the Serbian government outlaw school instruction in the Albanian language. In 1989, he succeeded in completely stripping Kosovo of its autonomy108 and sent in the Serbian Army and Serbian police units to maintain order and discipline after rioting occurred in response to the constitutional amendments revoking Kosovo autonomy. From 1989 through late 1992, Milosevic effectively enforced a state of emergency in Kosovo, in which Serbian "security" forces suppressed Albanian media, language education, protests, and strikes.

  Kosovo and other Yugoslav republics evinced strong concerns over Milosevic's actions in short order. Albanian legislators met secretly in 1990, declared the Republic of Kosovo to be in existence, and created a "shadow" Kosovo government—the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK)—led by Dr. Ibrahim Rugova. In an effort to avoid being similarly swept up in Milosevic's centralization and nationalistic policies, first Slovenia, in 1990, and then Croatia, in 1991, declared independence from Yugoslavia. Milosevic responded by sending Yugoslav tanks into Slovenia. As a result, Yugoslavia effectively ceased to exist as of 27 June 1991. By 1992 the situation within the region had deteriorated drastically. The Communist world in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe had collapsed and the call for revolution continued to drift across southern Europe and the Yugoslav republics. Already in dire straits as the result of a massive debt and triple-digit inflation and heavily dependent on Western aid, the Yugoslav economy bordered on collapse with the advent of an international economic embargo in late 1991 against Serbia and Montenegro. Slovenia had already achieved independence, and the bloody slugfest within Croatia continued. Macedonia declared independence in January 1992, and Bosnia and Herzegovina followed suit in March 1992. However, this declaration of Bosnian independence from Yugoslavia led only to a violent struggle between the Bosnian Serbs, supported by Serbia, and the Bosnian Muslims. The Serbs sought to divide the country along ethnic lines and unite with a "Greater Serbia." In the midst of all of this, Serbia and Montenegro joined together to form the new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in April 1992, with Milosevic at the helm. On one side of the Bosnian conflict were the Bosnian Serbs, led by Premiere Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, and the "Chetniks." They both had the support of Yugoslav National Army (JNA) units, and were intent on eradicating the Muslim population through terror tactics and a vicious ethnic cleansing program. Pitted against them were the Bosnian Muslims, who were merely attempting to hold on to as much territory as possible. To further complicate matters, however, the Bosnian Croats were also seeking to obtain Bosnian land for Croatia and were attacking Bosnian Muslims as well.

  During 1998, a full-fledged civil war opened up between Serbia and Kosovo. In the battles between Serb military and police forces and the KLA, thousands died and hundreds of thousands sought refuge elsewhere. Kosovo quickly became the foremost concern of the international community, posing grave humanitarian concerns and risking spillover into neighboring countries, which needed little to fan the existing embers of ethnic hatred and violence. A six-country "Contact Group" formed and initially called for negotiations on autonomy in place of armed conflict. Buttressed by internal support for his policies, Milosevic rejected the calls for Serbia to cease all military action in Kosovo. Instead, Milosevic sent more troops into Kosovo and escalated the level of fighting during the summer months of 1998. In response, the North Atlantic Council (NAC)130 asked NATO to explore and assess numerous military options to end the crisis in Kosovo.

 
  A January 2000 Report to Congress finds, "The Ushtria Clirimtare E Kosoves (UCK), or the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), was formed in the early 1990s with the goal of using force to create an independent Kosovo and, ultimately, a "Greater Albania* that would unite ethnic Albanians in Albania, Serbia, Macedonia, and Montenegro. A secretive organization with access to light infantry weapons and small amounts of explosives, the UCK in 1996 launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings and hit and-run attacks against Serb government facilities and personnel, as well as ethnic Albanians it suspected of collaboration with Serb authorities. The former UCK leadership continues to call for the independence of Kosovo. During the war, the leadership ceased public calls for a "Greater Albania." Beyond independence and economic reconstruction, the former UCK leadership has revealed little of its political platform. Further, neither the US, nor NATO, provided support to the KLA/UCK.

  UCK attacks had only a limited impact on Serb forces in Kosovo, and the group. remained a marginal force in the Kosovo Albanian autonomy movement. However, the deaths of 80 Kosovo Albanians, including many women and children, during a March 1998 raid by Serb security forces on a suspected UCK compound in central Kosovo galvanized support for armed resistance among ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the diaspora. The UCK seized the leadership of the growing insurgency and expanded quickly in the following months-in part due to the ready availability of large numbers of weapons and military equipment looted from Albanian Army stores during the previous year and a willingness of Kosovo Albanians to volunteer for service. Despite its growing strength, the UCK was unable to counter the Yugoslav Army offensive that started in March 1999. UCK units attempted to defend villages and protect ethnic Albanian civilians throughout Kosovo, but were overwhelmed by the Serbs' superior firepower. The deployment of international military forces into Kosovo in June 1999, however, brought an end to the fighting. The UCK agreed to demilitarize and transform into the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC), a non-military organization with civil defense duties, such as emergency rescue and disaster relief. KFOR officials in late August certified the UCK was compliant with the demilitarization requirements, and the UCK officially disbanded in late September 1999.

  The UCK leadership does not appear to have engaged in narcotics operations to support its activities during the war. Press reporting of various degrees of reliability indicates that some members of the former UCK are involved in narcotics smuggling, but we have no information on the scale of these activities. The UCK was not involved in terrorist activities-defined as premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets. We do not have a definitive count of the number of noncombatant civilians killed by the UCK since its formation. The UCK primarily targeted Serb government personnel and facilities, as well as ethnic Albanians who were suspected of collaborating with Serb authorities. However, press reports suggest that some UCK members have been involved in intimidation attacks and retribution killings since Serb forces withdrew from the province in June 1999."

  In addition, Scholars have concluded, "all available evidence refutes the proposition aggressively advanced by the Milosevic regime that the KLA was mainly financed by drug and prostitution money."<sup>[[1]](https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=c033421)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/report-on-kla)</sup></sup>

  Amid the unearthing of evidence of additional massacres and the continued rejection of peace overtures by Milosevic, the UN Security Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution (UNSCR) 1199 on 23 September 1998. The resolution called for an immediate cease-fire, an international presence, and the immediate withdrawal of Serbian troops from within Kosovo. Although the Serbs thereafter claimed to have complied, at least in part, the Contact Group observed no evidence of such compliance. Thus, while the Contact Group sent U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and others to Belgrade to obtain Milosevic's assurances of future compliance with the terms of the resolution, on 13 October 1998 NATO authorized air strikes in the event that Milosevic ultimately failed to comply.

  The Serb massacre of forty-five Albanians in the village of Racak on 15 January 1999 forced the international community’s hand once again. NATO issued a "solemn warning" to both sides that it would resort to military force immediately if they did not again heed the terms of the cease fire. In an effort to settle the rising tension, the Contact Group announced a peace conference in Rambouillet, France, near Paris, on 6 February 1999. The warring parties received Western-drafted proposals on how to resolve the ongoing conflict and were "provided" a deadline by which they were to agree to the proposals. Although the Serbs initially expressed a willingness to discuss the proposal's terms, they reneged at subsequent meetings held in Paris in mid-March. As a result, the negotiations ended, the violence in Kosovo intensified, the KVM withdrew, and NATO once again threatened a strong military response. On 22 March, Holbrooke attempted a "last-ditch" effort to convince Milosevic to sign the agreement and prevent a military confrontation. The international community hoped to avoid air strikes but nonetheless continued to plan them. However, Holbrooke’s efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. On 24 March, NATO forces began a campaign of air strikes—code-named Operation Allied Force—against FRY military targets to force the Serbs to cease hostilities and allow ethnic Albanian refugees to return to their homes in Kosovo.

  Finally, on 3 June, Milosevic and the Serbian National Assembly accepted a peace plan that arose out of negotiations initiated by Russian Special Envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin. On 10 June, after having received confirmation from SACEUR that Serb forces were withdrawing from Kosovo pursuant to the terms of a NATO–FRY Military-Technical Agreement (MTA) dated 9 June, NATO officially halted the air strikes. Also on 10 June, the UNSC passed UNSCR 1244, which welcomed the FRY's acceptance of the "principles on a political solution to the Kosovo crisis" and demanded the FRY's "full cooperation in their rapid implementation." Although 10 June brought an end to the military campaign, significant events occurred during the two-plus months of NATO military action. One week after the start of the campaign, the crisis in the region escalated when on 31 March Serbs captured three U.S. soldiers patrolling the FRY-FYROM border. In April 1999 Serb troops were responsible for the massacre of atl east forty-seven Albanian men, and the forced departure of thousands more, from the town of Djakovica. In response, NATO intensified its campaign of air strikes, bombing roads, bridges, oil production facilities, and other significant targets in the FRY.

  On 27 May 1999 the UN International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) unsealed an indictment accusing Milosevic and four other senior Yugoslav officials of committing numerous war crimes in Kosovo. In passing UNSCR 1244, the UNSC formally declared its adoption of the general principles upon which the political solution to the Kosovo crisis would be based and announced its decision to deploy an international civil presence and an international security presence under UN auspices within Kosovo. The international civil presence was entitled the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),and the international security presence was known as KFOR. On 12 June, synchronized with the departure of the FRY forces, the initial elements of KFOR rolled into Kosovo. This almost 50,000-member international force was to assume the critical peacekeeping mission in Kosovo—code-named Operation Joint Guardian. The U.S. contribution to this force, "Task Force Falcon," operated within one of the five multinational brigades within Kosovo that comprised KFOR—the Multinational Brigade East (MNB(E)), located in southeast Kosovo, bordering the FYROM and the FRY. By 20 June 1999 a majority of the FRY forces had vacated Kosovo, KFOR was well established, and NATO had formally terminated the air campaign.

  Montenegro discussed separating from the FRY. Milosevic's popularity with many Serbs began to plummet over the loss of Kosovo. On 24 September 2000, elections were held in the FRY and opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica emerged as the victor. Milosevic refused to release the complete results, however, and instead demanded a runoff election against Kostunica. In response to Milosevic's refusal to step down, massive public protests and demonstrations took place within Serbia. A general strike was called, and over one million people flooded Belgrade, ultimately attacking the Parliament building. Serb security forces either joined the demonstrators or retreated. On 5 October 2000, Milosevic finally conceded the election and stepped down. His Socialist Party, still maintaining a degree of political power, agreed to share power with two opposition parties. Yet after thirteen cruel years and four more Balkan wars, Milosevic's reign had finally come to a close.<sup>[[3]](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llmlp/Lessons-Learned_Kosovo/Lessons-Learned_Kosovo.pdf)</sup></sup>

#### NATO targeting/ROE

In a chapter of this highly acclaimed treatise, Tony Montgomery, outlines the targeting process during Operation Allied Force, emphasizing the systematic approach to managing proposed targets. Each day, new or updated target nominations were listed in a spreadsheet accessible through a classified system, enabling efficient legal evaluations. The process utilized two main methods for inputting legal reviews: an updated spreadsheet and collaborative targeting sessions (CTTs). CTTs improved coordination by allowing real-time discussions among various commands, addressing issues like military effectiveness, collateral damage estimates, and civilian casualty concerns. A four-tier system was developed to standardize collateral damage assessments, ranging from simple visual evaluations to complex simulations. Once targets were approved in CTTs, they required final approval from U.S. authorities before being added to the attack list. Stringent collateral damage considerations often influenced the type of munitions used and the timing of strikes. A daily review of proposed strikes was conducted to ensure compliance and prevent errors, allowing for corrections or cancellations as needed. Overall, the process emphasized thorough oversight and coordination to maintain legal and operational standards in targeting.<sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/legalethicalless78wall/mode/2up)</sup></sup>

#### Alleged NATO war crime examples

- A 2000 report, by the UNEP and IAEA experts, examined Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions use in the Balkans found: There was no detectable, widespread contamination of the ground surface by depleted uranium. This means that any widespread contamination is present in such low levels that it cannot be detected or differentiated from the natural uranium concentration found in rocks and soil. The corresponding radiological and toxicological risks are insignificant and even non-existent.

  Detectable ground surface contamination by DU is limited to areas within a few metres of penetrators and localised points of concentrated contamination (‘contamination points’) caused by penetrator impacts. A number of contamination points were identified by the mission but most of these were found to be only slightly contaminated. The majority of the radioactivity was attached to the surrounding asphalt, concrete or soil, with some attached to the loose sand present in some penetrator holes. In many cases, the radioactivity was so low that it was hardly detectable."

  There is no significant risk related to these contamination points in terms of possible contamination of air, water or plants. The only risk of any significance would be that someone touched the contamination point, thereby contaminating their hands (with a risk of subsequent transfer to the mouth), or directly ingested the contaminated soil. However, with reasonable assumptions on intake of soil, the corresponding radiological risk would be insignificant, while from a toxicological point of view, the possible intake might be somewhat higher than the applicable health standards." No DU-contaminated water, milk, objects, or buildings were found."<sup>[[5]](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/finalreport.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On May 7, 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, it was alleged that the US deliberately targeted the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. This was not the case. In summary, there were several crucial errors which led to the Chinese Embassy being struck: There was an error in locating the target. The approach used to attempt to locate the FDSP building was severely flawed. All sources of information used to prevent precisely this type of accident were either inaccurate or incomplete. The review process did not catch the locational error and did not consult any material or any person which could have provided correct information. There was in the immediate aftermath of the bombing some confusion as to what had happened and some of our early public statements were confused and contradictory. To summarize clearly and precisely: the attack on the PRC Embassy was the result of a series of errors that led to the destruction of the PRC Embassy instead of the Serb military target that was intended. The use of a map containing an error--the inaccurate location of the Chinese Embassy--contributed to the tragic mistake--but this was not due solely to a "map error." What went wrong was, first and foremost, that the approach used to locate the Bulevar Umetnosti 2, the address of the FDSP, was severely flawed. Second, the databases used to check and prevent this type of targeting error were also inaccurate, incomplete, and not fully independent. And third, the target review process did not detect the first two mistakes, nor did it involve people and information that could have provided additional data to correct or detect these errors.<sup>[[6]](https://1997-2001.state.gov/policy_remarks/1999/990617_pickering_emb.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001081870.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://irp.fas.org/congress/1999_hr/990722-hamre.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://web.archive.org/web/20000622032947/http://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/press_release/pr04102000.html)</sup></sup> ICTY agreed with these findings, and found no war crime had occurred. ICTY examined a number of high-profile incidents:

  - Grdelica train bombing is not a war crime. Per the independent findings of ICTY, "62. It is the opinion of the committee that the bridge was a legitimate military objective. The passenger train was not deliberately targeted. The person controlling the bombs, pilot or WSO, targeted the bridge and, over a very short period of time, failed to recognize the arrival of the train while the first bomb was in flight. The train was on the bridge when the bridge was targeted a second time and the bridge length has been estimated at 50 meters (Wenz study para 6 g above at p.25). It is the opinion of the committee that the information in relation to the attack with the first bomb does not provide a sufficient basis to initiate an investigation. The committee has divided views concerning the attack with the second bomb in relation to whether there was an element of recklessness in the conduct of the pilot or WSO. Despite this, the committee is in agreement that, based on the criteria for initiating an investigation (see para. 5 above), this incident should not be investigated. In relation to whether there is information warranting consideration of command responsibility, the committee is of the view that there is no information from which to conclude that an investigation is necessary into the criminal responsibility of persons higher in the chain of command."

  - The Attack on the Djakovica Convoy on 14/4/99, ICTY finds, "It is the opinion of the committee that civilians were not deliberately attacked in this incident. While there is nothing unlawful about operating at a height above Yugoslav air defences, it is difficult for any aircrew operating an aircraft flying at several hundred miles an hour and at a substantial height to distinguish between military and civilian vehicles in a convoy. In this case, most of the attacking aircraft were F16s with a crew of one person to fly the aircraft and identify the target. As soon as the crews of the attacking aircraft became aware of the presence of civilians, the attack ceased."

  - Further, "NATO intentionally bombed the Radio and TV station and the persons killed or injured were civilians. The questions are: was the station a legitimate military objective and; if it was, were the civilian casualties disproportionate to the military advantage gained by the attack? For the station to be a military objective within the definition in Article 52 of Protocol I: a) its nature, purpose or use must make an effective contribution to military action and b) its total or partial destruction must offer a definite military advantage in the circumstances ruling at the time. The 1956 ICRC list of military objectives, drafted before the Additional Protocols, included the installations of broadcasting and television stations of fundamental military importance as military objectives (para. 39 above). The list prepared by Major General Rogers included broadcasting and television stations if they meet the military objective criteria (para. 38 above). As indicated in paras. 72 and 73 above, the attack appears to have been justified by NATO as part of a more general attack aimed at disrupting the FRY Command, Control and Communications network, the nerve centre and apparatus that keeps Milosević in power, and also as an attempt to dismantle the FRY propaganda machinery. Insofar as the attack actually was aimed at disrupting the communications network, it was legally acceptable."<sup>[[10]](https://www.icty.org/en/press/final-report-prosecutor-committee-established-review-nato-bombing-campaign-against-federal)</sup></sup>

### Bosnian War (1992–1995)

- In June 1991, simmering ethnic tensions within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia came to a peak after the legislatures of Slovenia and Croatia voted overwhelmingly to declare their independence. As an immediate response to their secessions, the Yugoslav government issued a statement claiming such declarations to be "illegal" and "illegitimate" and ordered its military to secure their borders. Two days later, the national Yugoslav People's Army ("JNA"), whose Commander and a majority of whose soldiers were Serbian, responded with force and invaded Slovenia to prevent its separation, but the JNA was met with strong resistance. In Croatia, fighting erupted between Croatian security forces and minority Serb irregulars, who had the backing of the JNA. The Croatian forces quickly lost an estimated one- third of the country to the Serb insurgents. Each of the warring factions, the Serbs, Bosnian Serbs and later the Bosnian Croats, declared regions of territory as "ethnically pure, autonomous" areas under their control, and fiercely fought to protect and expand their holdings.

  In response to the civil unrest in Yugoslavia, the European Community ("EC") convened an emergency meeting of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe ("CSCE"). The CSCE urged the warring factions to accept a cease-fire and sent observers to Yugoslavia to monitor their compliance and troop movement. However, throughout the summer of 1991, while cease-fires were negotiated, signed, and violated, the JNA continued to launch military offensives in Croatia.

  In its third meeting on this subject, the CSCE passed a resolution calling for the imposition of an aims embargo against all parties to the conflict. On September 25, 1991, the Bush Administration, on behalf of the United States, supported the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 713 ("UNSC Res. 713"). The resolution imposed a complete embargo on all weapons and equipment deliveries to the former Yugoslavia—including Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. Shortly thereafter, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 724, to establish a Sanctions Committee that would monitor compliance with the embargo. Resolution 713, in concert with United National Security Council Resolutions 740 and 787 which addressed the implementation of the embargo, called on all nations to abide by the embargo, but did not legally require countries to enforce the embargo.

  The United Nations arms embargo was intended to contain the war and prevent the entry of additional countries into the conflict. One of the consequences of the embargo, however, was the preservation of Serbian military superiority over the other republics due to the Serbs' alliance with the JNA and the extensive supply of equipment and munitions within the JNA arsenal. Throughout 1991, the JNA continued to attack various Croatian cities. In Zagreb, governmental buildings, including President Tudjman's office, were shelled. In the coastal town of Dubrovnik, the JNA cut off the power and water supplies, and severed telephone links for weeks at a time. In November, the Serbian forces finally left Vukovar, a city of 45,000, in ruins after months of fighting. The first United Nations-sponsored cease-fire went into effect on November 23, 1991 but quickly collapsed, as intense fighting continued elsewhere in Croatia. In January, 1992 the first European Community casualties were reported. Five military observers sent by the CSCE were shot down in their marked helicopter. From this moment, it was evident that a larger international presence was needed to maintain peace in the region. Shortly thereafter, the United Nations sent a team to Croatia to lay the groundwork for the deployment of international peacekeeping troops. With United States support, the passage of United Nations Resolution 743 authorized the establishment of the 14,000-strong United Nations Protection Force ("UNPROFOR") for an initial service of twelve months. The troops were composed of platoons from many nations including Great Britain, France, Canada, Egypt, Malaysia and the Russian Federation and were dispatched throughout the region in areas of heavy fighting and relative calm.

  On 9 October 1992, UN Security Council passed resolution 781, which prohibited unauthorized military flights in Bosnian airspace. This led to Operation Sky Monitor, where NATO monitored violations of the no-fly zone, but it did not take action against violators of the resolution. In response to over 500 documented violations, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 816, which authorized states to use measures "to ensure compliance" with the no-fly zone over Bosnia. NATO's Operation Deny Flight, which lasted from April 12, 1993 to Dec 20, 1995, enforced this UNSCR compliance.<sup>[[11]](https://www.afhistory.af.mil/FAQs/Fact-Sheets/Article/459001/operation-deny-flight/)</sup></sup>

#### Conclusion on aid allegations

  Several investigations were conducted to examine the charges. In total, millions of classified records were examined, many hundreds of individuals interviewed and cross-examined. The following are the core conclusions of these independent & authoritative studies. Above are, are specific areas of concern, to clarify the confusing record left in the wake of sensationalist headlines and conspiracy theories:

   - "From the outset of the Clinton Administration, it was United Slates policy neither to oppose nor support third party arms transfers to Bosnia-Herzegovina. This policy was embodied In the "no instructions" response to the Croatian Government's question on the United States view on the transshipment of arms. It served several important United States interests, and helped establish conditions on the ground that pointed the way to peace. The United States took no action to aid arms transfers to the former Yugoslavia. At no time did any United States government official take any action to supply arms to any country or entity covered by the U.N. arms embargo. At no time did any United States government official undertake any covert action to supply arms to any country or entity covered by the embargo, or to encourage, aid or assist in the shipment or transfer of arms to any country in the former Yugoslavia. No United States Government official coordinated, cooperated, conspired with or suggested to the Bosnian Muslims, the Government of Croatia, or the Bosnian Croats that the United States be asked to state its view of the transshipment of arms. United States Government officials directed Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith to respond that he had "no instructions" when asked for the reaction of the United States government to the transshipment of arms through Croatia to Bosnia by the government of Croatia. Ambassador Galbraith carried out his directions correctly and promptly. There was no "greenlight" for Iran.<sup>[[12]](https://archive.org/details/bosnia-arms)</sup></sup> 

   - "The Committee found no evidence that the United States ever provided such support or any quid pro quo to Croatia, or encouraged any country to provide arms or military assistance in violation of the arms embargo, despite the fact that on September 27, 1994, Bosnia did publicly call for a United Nations resolution lifting the arms embargo that would incorporate a six-month delay."<sup>[[13]](https://archive.org/details/united-states-actions-regarding-iranian)</sup></sup>

   - "Based on the facts developed during the Committee's inquiry into the matter of the shipment of Iranian arms into Bosnia, we believe that the following conclusions are inescapable: (1) the United States government undertook no covert action to ship weapons to Bosnia or Croatia; (2) No U.S. official directed, controlled or facilitated the shipment of Iranian arms to Bosnia or Croatia; (3) No U.S. official violated U.S. law relating to covert action, intelligence activities, or notifications to Congress; (4) No discrepancies justifying a criminal investigation exist in the testimony of the witnesses who appeared before the Committee; and (5) Nothing in the Committee's inquiry contradicts the findings of the 1995 and 1996 investigations of the President's Intelligence Oversight Board."<sup>[[14]](https://archive.org/details/investigation-into-iranian-arms-shipment)</sup></sup>

- Able Archer, in 1983, didn't come close to starting a nuclear war, as many revisionists allege. Simon Miles, in his earth-shattering examination, reviewed declassified records from various countries to prove the origins of this claim stem from Soviet disinformation.<sup>[[1]](https://direct.mit.edu/jcws/article-abstract/22/3/86/95296/The-War-Scare-That-Wasn-t-Able-Archer-83-and-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/discussions/7415273/h-diplo-article-review-1024-war-scare-wasn%E2%80%99t)</sup></sup>

-  Arising in August 1980 as the first independent trade union in Eastern Europe, Solidarity rapidly grew into a national protest movement against Poland’s chronically inept Communist regime. It enjoyed legal status for a year and half. Then, on the night of 12/13 December 1981, a junta calling itself the Military Council of National Salvation, headed by strongman Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, seized power and declared martial law. Military and security forces put the entire country on lockdown and rounded up thousands of Solidarity members in a carefully planned nationwide dragnet. A few leaders remained free and sent a message to the West asking for help. On 4 November 1982, Ronald Reagan signed a Presidential Finding that authorized the CIA to covertly provide money and non-lethal aid to the Polish underground movement known as Solidarity. The CIA assigned the cryptonym QRHELPFUL to its operation. The stated goal was to “to keep the spirit of Solidarity alive” by supporting “moderate elements” in Solidarity. This accorded with the intentions and goals of the mainstream underground activists. Their “limited revolution” sought to wrest concessions and rights from the Communist regime without seeking to overthrow it or withdraw from the Soviet-controlled Warsaw Pact.<sup>[[1]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08850607.2019.1565587)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08850607.2012.652523)</sup> </sup>  <sup>[[3]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08850607.2016.1121054)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.cia.gov/static/US-Intelligence-and-the-Polish-Crisis-1980-1981-1.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Between 1948-1956, Italy, the CIA aided centrists; socially/economically left-wing governments; labor unions; student groups and other socialist groups to provide political stability in preventing Soviet-backed right-wing authortarian groups to take hold—leading to a decade of democratic socialism. In total, only $3 million was provided to these various groups. A study finding, "The defeat of the Right meant that Communism's threat would be met through democratic politics, not a reversion to Fascism. The strength of the Socialists, even without aid from the outside, meant that left-wing sentiment looked toward a democratic form of socialism."<sup>[[1]](https://ia801601.us.archive.org/14/items/Combating-Communism-Italy-1953-1956/Combating-Communism-Italy-1953-56.pdf)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged that the CIA and NATO, supported right-wing terror groups in Italy (and elsewhere in Europe) from the 50s to the 90s, under "Operation Gladio"—to suppress left-wing governments and movements. This claim has been long-discredited by the consensus of Cold war historians. The US State Department confirmed some "evidence" of false flags were nothing more than KGB forgeries. The CIA did have a limited, brief effort to have organised resistance groups in Europe, in case the Soviet empire engaged in imperialistic shenanigans. However, nothing as described by the historical revisionists. In total, only a few dozen individuals were ever trained; they never did anything—and the programs quickly dropped.<sup>[[1]](https://direct.mit.edu/jcws/article-abstract/16/4/35/13485/Stay-Behind-A-Clandestine-Cold-War-Phenomenon?redirectedFrom=fulltext)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390701676485)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.scribd.com/document/114855262/Misinformation-About-Gladio-Stay-Behind-Networks-Resurfaces)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02684520500340357)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390500448524)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850600500332656)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16161262.2005.10555113)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://www.cia.gov/static/9f3bcb469cee52fd1017f1c7c84aeadc/intel-officers-bookshelf-11.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390701676493)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390701676501)</sup></sup>

  Regarding the Italian Commission, which has been a foundation for the conspiracy theory—academics, including prominent Italian Historians have long-since debunked the Commission's draft report. One observes, "The interpretation that Pellegrino invoked had first been developed by in a now well-known essay by Franco De Felice published in 1989. Looking for the keys to understand Italy’s history since the Second World War, De Felice revived the idea of a ‘double State’, meaning that state apparatuses and their administrators had a ‘dual loyalty’; loyalty both to the nascent institutions of the Republic but also to the international alignment of which Italy was part. De Felice’s essay developed ‘a complex and refined conceptual framework that could only with difficulty be applied to an equally complex reality’. However, its subsequent ‘journalistic appropriation (and unfortunately not only by journalists) transformed the idea into a standard, all-purpose explanation that became a kind of universal container in which to locate and explain all the dark plots, all the unsolved mysteries in the history of Republican Italy. Pellegrino’s reconstruction stretched this interpretive framework to its logical extremes and in ways that went far beyond De Felice’s original reasoning. The document was never submitted to the Commission’s final vote and thus remained first and foremost an expression of the chairman’s own views.

  From a historiographical perspective, however, although Pellegrino claims that his draft report was nothing more than ‘the outcome of a historical reconstruction that was already established and freely accessible not only in judicial archives but also on the shelves of any library’ (Pellegrino Report, 7), these claims are open to numerous criticisms (see Lupo 2013a, 72 – 78, 2013b; Sabbatucci 1999; on Pellegrino’s reconstruction of the Moro Affair, see Giovagnoli 2005. In particular, these critics have challenged the Pellegrino Report’s obsessively conspiratorial vision that constantly frames Italian history as an anomaly determined almost exclusively on external factors. These criticisms certainly did not seek to deny the importance of the constraints imposed by the international context, but served to draw attention to the severe distortion that resulted from attributing exclusive importance to these constraints alone. In other words, the attempt to find a unitary explanation for everything that had happened in Italy over a period of forty years gave rise to numerous exaggerations and more generally underestimated the internal dynamics of the country and its history."<sup>[[11]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1354571X.2015.1026148)</sup></sup>

  Historian Kevin Ruffner finds, "Not only did OPC organize emigre groups for both propaganda tools and operational purposes, Frank Wisner also launched a program to train Eastern Europeans for clandestine operations against the Soviet Union. Wisner approved ZRELOPE in late July 1950 because "the acceleration of extensive OPC operations in the Soviet Union and its satellites, and further pursuance of resistance activities elsewhere abroad require the utilization of strong numbers of specially-trained personnel native to the area concerned." OPC estimated that it needed to train some 2,000 personnel over the next year in such fields as political warfare operations, resistance operations, escape and evasion  operations, communications, and "the will to fight and will to lead." OPC's use of emigres coincided with mounting interest among the US government agencies to organize displaced persons into paramilitary formations. Given the poor security environment in Germany (the Russian Intelligence Services had targeted virtually every emigre group there), OPC proposed to train these personnel in the United States. Prior to launching ZRELOPE, OPC formed a special task group to contact both Federal agencies and private individuals about the feasibility of this project. By November 1950, this group presented its report and recommended that OPC train a "diverse group" of foreigners in the United States for covert operations and establish a civilian cover committee "in order to sponsor trainees and disburse funds." The group also recommended that the DCI approve ZRELOPE and obtain similar approbation from the National Security Council (neither level of approval was mandatory for OPC projects at the time). In December 1950, OPC decided to initiate a pilot program with 100 trainees.

  While OPC sought a suitable facility for ZRELOPE (it selected Grand Bahama Island in Florida after examining 70 sites), a number of unforeseen problems arose. ZRELOPE, for example, suffered from splintered command and control within OPC. Whereas [redacted headed up Task Group BOULDER (which formulated overall planning and delivery of the candidates to the United States), OPC's Eastern Europe Division (EE) ran the selection, recruitment, and clearing of ZRELOPE trainees. The Training Division (TRD), a joint OSO/OPC element, trained the candidates and provided for cover and security of the project and its personnel. Project ZRELOPE had a grueling schedule. [redacted] chief of EE told [redacted] in March 1951 that the Department of Defense required 1,000 graduates by June 1952. To facilitate the selection of candidates, Frank Wisner informed the ADSO that same month that OPC needed to interview some four to five thousand candidates in Europe in order to fill the required 2,000 training slots. Wisner added, "as each candidate will require a field security investigation prior to final screening, a heavy burden will fall upon your field organizations, especially in Germany and Austria." The project's haste naturally raised questions about the thoroughness of the background investigations of the selected recruits. [redacted] of EE traveled to Germany in May 1951 to review the progress of ZRELOPE and its subprojects, JBPLEDGE (recruitment of trainees) and KMKIMONO (recruitment of instructors). 28 OPC planned to draw from some 60 "guard companies," with approximately 200 men each, performing various housekeeping tasks at US Army garrisons throughout Germany. By May of 1951, [redacted] stimated that some 60 percent of the guard company members had already been canvassed and that OPC had selected nearly 800 candidates. OPC had five case officers to do the screening, although a native Russian speaker handled the initial interviews and conducted the records checks. Candidates then traveled to Munich for psychological assessments. The actual recruitment occurred after the psychological assessment. Despite morale problems (the candidates did not want to leave their families in Germany), [redacted]  presented an optimistic appraisal. "I believe," he noted, "they will turn up in time a sufficient number of likely candidates to produce 100 willing candidates that can be started moving to the states between September 1st and September 15th [1951]. In saying that, I believe that we will be able to procure the minimum number of personnel which they require, that the field security will be able to speed up the results of their security checks and that home security will do the same. The security issue posed a serious problem, as [redacted] of TRD discovered in early 1951. Lt. Col. William R. Peers, an OSS veteran and Army officer serving as TRD's chief, found OPC's selection of ZRELOPE candidates to be less than adequate. Peers told Wisner that "although the foreign division concerned will be responsible for the selection of the students, including the checking of their security and political affiliations, it is readily apparent that if these matters are not given full consideration and properly handled initially, the Training Division later may be faced with the situation of having numerous security problems on its hands which by that time it will be powerless to correct."

  After great discussion and even greater expense, ZRELOPE proved to be a short-lived program. It failed because OPC could not recruit and vet candidates to meet its goal of 2,000 trained resistance fighters. The paramilitary aspect of ZRELOPE (known as ZRCORSET) was the first subproject to be discontinued because of a lack of recruits. In turn, CIA soon abandoned efforts to procure a "suitable" training area in the United States for the project. The political action element of ZRELOPE, or ZRDAMSEL, conducted a class in 1952 for a dozen-odd students at a hotel near Winchester, Virginia, utilizing the cover of the Franklin Development Foundation of Philadelphia. Despite plans to bring a new class to the training site, CIA canceled the entire program in November 1952. TRD estimated that the political action portion of ZRELOPE alone cost $30,000 per student—an incredible expense for little gain.

  The Hot War Cadre Programs:

  Despite the disappointing results of ZRELOPE, CIA continued to believe it could fashion the emigres into a potent fighting force in the event of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. Several CIA projects concentrated on the recruitment of foreigners for paramilitary or insertion training in the United States. Even as OPC dropped ZRELOPE, it expanded an earlier project, WSBAKERY. In January 1952, OPC (with OSO's consent) organized Project AEACRE, which called for the establishment of a Domestic Operations Base (DOB) near Washington, DC, that would allow the Agency to interrogate, assess, and prepare agents for dispatch into the Soviet Union. Like ZRELOPE, AEACRE encountered problems in recruiting knowledgeable instructors as well as in finding suitable agent candidates. This project, however, had no difficulties in the "black" entry and exit processing of agents thanks to the cooperation of the US Air Force and the INS. This aspect of CIA's covert training seems to have rarely posed a problem. The majority of personnel trained at DOB participated in REDSOX missions. These operations declined after the mid-1950s as CIA realized their futility, but the Soviet suppression of Hungary in 1956, however, rejuvenated DOB because the Joint Chiefs of Staff assigned new unconventional warfare tasks to the CIA. AEACRE spawned a new project in 1956 as the CIA upgraded its "hot war" plans in anticipation of the need for a reserve body of trained agents. In late 1956, Project AEREADY came into existence to build up a force of personnel, native to various target areas of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East, who possessed area knowledge, language skills, and paramilitary training. Following basic training under CIA auspices, these agents returned home to their civilian jobs and held themselves ready for emergency callup and annual refresher training. Unlike either ZRELOPE or AEACRE, AEREADY did not require overseas recruitment or transportation to the United States. Rather, the new project identified these specialized individuals from INS rosters of immigrants and displaced persons already in America. AEREADY, however, also suffered from a lack of suitable personnel. After extensive nationwide searches, CIA ended up assessing 27 candidates for each successful agent that completed training. Members of the US armed forces with foreign language skills provided the initial cadre of AEREADY trainees.

  The Army provided cover for Project AEREADY at Fort Meade, Maryland, where it established Material Testing Unit No. 1. Similar units were also organized for specialized training at Army posts in North Carolina, Virginia, and New York. By 1961, AEREADY (known as AEDEPOT after 1958) had produced a pool of 63 reserve agents from 13 ethnic groups. Ukrainians formed the largest single body of agents with 17 personnel, followed by Russians, Latvians, and Lithuanians. 45 CIA integrated teams of AEDEPOT personnel into various military training exercises, both in the United States and in Europe. The need to maintain a reserve cadre of European agents, however, diminished in the 1960s as the threat of Soviet invasion of Europe receded. In its place, communist insurgencies in Latin America and Southeast Asia posed new challenges that prompted CIA to reconsider its reserve hot war program. In 1966, the Agency deactivated WUDEPOT (as AEACRE and AEDEPOT had been redesignated two years earlier). While a handful of the reserve agents served in Latin America and Vietnam, the cancellation of WUDEPOT effectively ended the CIA's paramilitary training of Eastern Europe emigres."<sup>[[12]](https://ia801301.us.archive.org/17/items/EagleAndSwastika/Eagle%20and%20Swastika.pdf#page=284)</sup></sup>

The wiki entry states, "during William Colby's confirmation hearing to be Director of Central Intelligence, Colby was asked by Stuart Symington, chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, if there was any justification for the assertions.

- It has been alleged that the CIA was involved in the Hungarian revolution against the brutal, authortarian Communist Stalinist regime; that the US signaled it would covertly, or overtly, help the democratic movement against the regime and USSR forces and that it had turned a blind-eye to the democratic revolution. However, a comprensive and authoritative declassified study reveals this isn't true. While the US was sympathtic to the Hungarian people, and pressing diplomacy at the UN, it was trying to avoid another world war: By disrupting the Soviet Union's atrocities agaisnt the movement, whilst also dealing with global matters that could have also sparked global conflict, such as the Suez crisis.<sup>[[1]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/MDR_Releases/FY12/12-M-1691.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/MDR_Releases/FY16/10-M-0524-13-M-3442/Almost_Successful_Recipe.pdf)</sup></sup> Several other authoritative studies reached the same conclusion.<sup>[[3]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP99-01448R000401630009-6.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001409017.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://archive.org/details/broadcastingfree0000pudd_r1h8/mode/2up)</sup></sup>

- Adolf Heusinger was not a nazi nor war criminal, despite pundit accusations. Promoted to colonel on 1 August 1940 and became chief of the Operationsabteilung in October 1940, which made him number three in the army's planning hierarchy, after the Chief of the General Staff, General Franz Halder, and the Deputy Chief of the General Staff/Chief Quartermaster, General Friedrich Paulus. After the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the OKH became responsible primarily for planning operations in that theatre, and the Armed Forces High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, or OKW) was responsible for other theatres. Halder was replaced as Chief of the General Staff in September 1942 by General Kurt Zeitzler. Heusinger remained chief of the Operationsabteilung and was promoted to Generalleutnant on 1 January 1943. In June 1944, Zeitzler suffered a nervous breakdown and abandoned his post, and on 10 June, Heusinger temporarily assumed his office as Chief of the General Staff of the Army. In this capacity, he attended the meeting at Hitler's Wolf's Lair on 20 July 1944, and he was standing next to Hitler when the bomb exploded that had been planted by Claus von Stauffenberg.

  Heusinger was hospitalised for his injuries in the explosion but was later arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo to determine his role, if any, in the 20 July Plot. 
  
  Since he was not accused of being a nazi, or a war criminal, he provided key testimony in the WW2 Tribunals. Heusinger's personal beliefs and political views were that of pro-democracy, and naturally found himself in support of the free West. Because of his skills in military planning operations. With the establishment of the West Germany Armed Forces Bundeswehr in 1955, Heusinger returned to military service. He was appointed a Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) on 12 November 1955, in the Bundeswehr and chairman of the Military Leadership Council.
  
  Shortly thereafter, in June 1957, Heusinger was promoted to full general and named the first Inspector General of the Bundeswehr, and he served in that capacity until March 1961. In April 1961, he was appointed Chair of the NATO Military Committee for Germany until 1964. The US had no say on this.<sup>[[1]](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/who_is_who_134296.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123033424/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/HEUSINGER%2C%20ADOLF_0006.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1949, the CIA supported the resistance movement against the oppressive, authoritarian Hoxha dictatorship in Albania. This was done through psychological and intelligence operations—which was widely supported by the local population, despite knowing the risks should they be found out by their oppressors. As one world-leading historian writes, "It has commonly been misread either as an all-out paramilitary effort to overthrow Albania’s communist government, or as a probe to test the feasibility of ‘rollback’ against Enver Hoxha’s regime and, by extension, the wider Soviet bloc. Recently declassified documents in the US and British archives—still largely neglected by historians—reveal that BGFIEND/Valuable was neither primarily a paramilitary campaign to overthrow Albania’s communist regime, nor a limited probe to test the viability of rollback behind the iron curtain. Instead, for the majority of its life, the operation principally constituted a psychological warfare campaign to subvert and harass Albania’s communist government, not to overthrow it, while keeping open the possibility of toppling the regime in the future. Removing Hoxha also risked undermining western cohesion by sparking territorial disputes between key allies Italy, Greece and Turkey. The status quo was therefore preferable to a provocative rollback effort, leading Anglo-American policymakers to indefinitely suspend their aggressive ambitions just six months after authorizing Hoxha’s overthrow." Sadly, "many who lost their lives or liberty infiltrating Albania, or to the many Albanian citizens who were ruthlessly suppressed by Hoxha’s police state in this period."<sup>[[1]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684527.2020.1754711?journalCode=fint20)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/obopus-bg-fiend-cia-operation-albania)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20150401215624/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/1705143/OBOPUS%20BGFIEND%20%20%20VOL.%2020%20%20%28BGFIEND%20OPERATIONS%29_0012.pdf)</sup></sup> To note: BGFIEND was the cryptonym for the US project.

- It was alleged that the CIA's predecessor, OSS—was involved in aiding Nazi war criminals to further US Scientific inquiry and Intelligence operations, under "operation paperclip." This is a distortion of truth. It has been confirmed that there was no operation to rescue nazisfrom prosecution. As Allan Ryan, former Director of the Office of Special Investigation (the office to which Nazis were prosecuted) said,"From time to time in the past few years, books or other accounts have appeared claiming to expose some newly-discovered conspiracy by CIA, or the military, or a cabal of lawless bureaucrats, to bring Nazi collaborators to the United States after the war." "These accounts," according to Ryan, "have offered dubious evidence and have been unable to survive any objective analysis. 

  In a landmark treatise of all CIA files (still classified, those declassified), and public accounting, Historian Kevin Ruffner examines the role of PL 110, Sec 8. which has been misconstrued as the legal authority for this alleged Nazi smuggling. The purpose and use of this law was to facilitate defectors, including Communist defectors. No Nazi war criminals were permitted to enter, nor did any. Out of the total number of immigrants permitted to the US, between 1949 and 1982, only 3 may have had a connection to nazism. Another 3 had served in the German army and 3 in the Vlasov army. Ruffner concludes, "What can be summarized as the legacy of the Agency's Cold War defector program? Initially, OSS wanted to reward its European agents for faithful service during the war. Within months, however, this changed as the Soviets drew a tighter grip over Eastern Europe and the Americans found it necessary to evacuate its covert personnel from danger. The United States did not have a set plan to permit the emigration of its agents from Europe or to deal with defectors or deserters from the Soviet bloc. As a result, SSU, CIG, and CIA gradually slipped into the role as the responsible agency to handle defectors and their resettlement. By 1949, the problem of how to deal with these people had become critical, especially in Germany. New laws, such as the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 and the CIA Act of 1949, provided some help, but the NSC intelligence directives gave real direction to the Agency. After 1950, the Central Intelligence Agency was fully committed to using defectors as a weapon in fighting the Cold War. While an imperfect weapon, CIA did not deliberately use its position to "smuggle" Nazis out of Europe or to bring them or their collaborators to the United States.<sup>[[1]](https://ia801301.us.archive.org/17/items/EagleAndSwastika/Eagle%20and%20Swastika.pdf#page=410)</sup></sup>
  
  As for Barbie: The 1983 Ryan report, concluded, "at no time from the end of World War II to the present time has the Central Intelligence Agency had any relationship with Klaus Barbie." He also determined that the "CIA was not involved in the use, control, or financing" of the rat line from Austria to Italy and then to South America that allowed Barbie to escape in 1951. Further, "the united States government has had no relationship of any kind with Klaus Barbie since he departed from Europe in 1951." As for the timeline and the Army's CIC: CIC personnel had no reliable indication until at least May 1949, some two years after Barbie was first employed, that he was suspected of war crimes or crimes against humanity. Not until the summer of 1950 did the French provide the evidence to the US Government. Further, it was not offered to, and was not reasonably available to, CIC officials, who had no reason even to know that it existed." A handful of CIC personnel misled HICOG's attempts to carry out its lawful obligation to decide the extradition of Klaus Barbie."<sup>[[2]](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-hrsp/legacy/2011/02/04/08-02-83barbie-rpt.pdf#page=212)</sup></sup>

  The CIA, (more than any), aided in bringing such justice in aiding the DOJ's OSI. In his role as director of the OSI, Ryan wrote, "no Federal agency, including the CIA, ever objected to any prosecution or tried to call off any investigation."<sup>[[4]](https://ia801301.us.archive.org/17/items/EagleAndSwastika/Eagle%20and%20Swastika.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201018014445/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol40no5/pdf/v40i5a12p.pdf)</sup></sup>

  There was a project paperclip, under the War Department, through the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA), established in 1945 as a subcommittee of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). However, this also did not protect and rescue nazis. "Persons proposed to be brought to the U.S. hereunder shall be screened by the Commanding General, USFET, on the basis of available records. No person found by the Commanding General, USFET, to have been a member of the Nazi Party and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an active supporter of Nazism or militarism shall be brought to the U.S. hereunder. However, neither position nor honors awarded a specialist under the Nazi Regime solely on account of his scientific or technical ability will in themselves be considered sufficient to disqualify a specialist for evacuation to the U.S. hereunder. Where there is doubt as to qualification of a specialist under the preceding sentence, the Commanding General, USFET, may transport the specialist to the U.S., where further interrogation and screening shall be conducted immediately in order to determine such qualification. All specialists and families brought to the United States will be under temporary, limited military custody until such time as visas are granted or repatriation is accomplished.

  Arthur Rudolph. OSI found, "Rudolph was one of the first Germans to come to the United States under Operation Paperclip; he arrived in December 1945. Although INS knew that he had been a member of the Nazi party and that he had worked at Mittelwerk, there is no indication that they had any information about his use of slave labor. State Department visa regulations prohibited the entry of an alien "who has been guilty of, or has advocated or acquiesced in, activities or conduct contrary to civilization and human decency on behalf of the Axis countries." Rudolph became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1954 and worked in the U.S. rocket program until his retirement from NASA in 1969." Further, story about his use of slave labour only became public in 1979. After learning this, OSI conducted two more interviews—when he clarified, DOJ authorised a filing against him. He had two options: Be persecuted, or renounce citizenship and leave the US. He decided to leave.<sup>[[8]](https://ia904605.us.archive.org/14/items/osi-report-06/OSI_report_06.pdf#page=342)</sup></sup> 

  In the last year of the war, the German military situation became increasingly desperate. The failure of the 20 July 1944 plot against Hitler and the bloody roundup of coup suspects meant that there was little chance for the German resistance to negotiate an end to the war. As the Soviets and Western Allies drew ever closer to Germany itself, various German officials began to extend peace feelers to the British and Americans. In December 1944, Dulles's agent, Gero von Schulze Gaevernitz, told Dulles that Alexander von Neurath, the German consul in Lugano, was in close contact with senior German military and SS officers searching for an American contact to discuss surrender terms. Dulles was forced to reject this feeler because President Roosevelt and Gen. William J. Donovan, the director of OSS, had expressed concern about the reaction of the Soviet allies to any negotiations by the Western Allies with the Germans." Over the next several months, Dulles continued to receive feelers in Switzerland from senior SS officers, including such notable Nazis as Heinrich Himmler, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, and Walter Schellenberg. But these contacts all came with strings attached, such as the requirement that the Americans and the British join forces with the Germans to fight the Soviets. At the same time, intelligence reports and simple rumors underscored the German determination to fight to the last man by fortifying the Alpine regions of southern Germany and Austria. The so-called "National Redoubt" concerned American planners who were anxious to avoid a major loss of lives at the end of the war. From the Allied perspective, Operation SUNRISE offered a way to end the fighting in Italy while ensuring that the Germans could not mount a last-ditch battle in the Alps.

  By late 1944, various SS officials in Italy and in Germany decided to contact the Allies. One of these undertakings, codenamed WESTWIND, failed because of rivalries at the highest levels of the SS. By mid-February 1945, SS-Obergruppenfuhrer Karl Wolff, the commander of all SS troops in Italy, told Walther Rauff, a subordinate SS officer, that he wanted to establish contact with the Allies in neutral Switzerland. Rauff mentioned this to another SS officer, Guido Zimmer, who suggested Baron Luigi Parilli as an intermediary. Parilli, the prewar European representative of a prominent American company, was closely tied to Zimmer and may have been one of his agents. The Italian claimed that Zimmer's love for Italy and his concern that the Germans would unleash a "scorched earth" policy motivated both men to seek the Allies. Through Professor Max Husmann, a Swiss schoolmaster, Parilli received a visa to visit Switzerland and present the German proposal to Maj. Max Waibel, a Swiss intelligence officer and a contact of Allen Dulles, the OSS station chief in Bern. This led to the first meeting between Gero von Gaevernitz and Parilli in Lucerne and the beginning of Operation SUNRISE. In March 1945, Dulles and Gaevernitz met in Switzerland with Wolff. Dulles knew that Wolff wanted to discuss surrender terms, but the OSS station chief made continued discussions conditional upon the release of several Italian resistance leaders in German captivity. Wolff told Dulles that he wanted to surrender SS forces to the Allies and that he would work to get Field Marshal Albert Kesslering, commander of all German military forces in Italy, and his successor, Field Marshal Heinrich von Vietinghoff, to do the same.  Guido Zimmer played a steady role in facilitating German feelers with the OSS in Switzerland. Within days after the first meeting between Gaevernitz and Parilli in February 1945, Zimmer and another German officer, SS-Standartenfuhrer Eugen Dollmann, traveled to Lugano to meet with the Americans. Dollmann had served as a translator for Hitler when he visited Mussolini. Himmler valued Dollmann for his social and political contacts in Rome. As events unfolded, Zimmer continued to be a key point of contact and even coordinated the placement of a Czech-born OSS radio operator, Vaclav Hradecky, first at the SS headquarters in Milano and later in Bolzano. With Zimmer's protection, Hradecky, known as "Little Walter," provided communications between Allied headquarters in Caserta and the Germans in northern Italy.

  In the meantime, Wolff met with Dulles and other British and American officers in northern Italy to continue the preliminary discussions. Feelers by other senior SS officials complicated Wolff's own efforts to deal with the Western Allies. Hitler, in fact, learned of Wolff's activities, but did not take any action against the SS general. The death of President Roosevelt in April also created new problems when Dulles received orders to drop all contact with the Germans. After further delays and more frustration, Dulles nonetheless succeeded in getting two representatives of the German army and SS to sign the surrender documents on 29 April 1945. A more moderate element in the Waffen SS. The fact that Operation SUNRISE ended the war in Italy has been overshadowed by other, more ominous, characterizations of the surrender in the decades after 1945. Historians, journalists, and even some intelligence officers have downplayed the importance of the secret surrender and criticized Allen Dulles for promoting his own role and that of the OSS. More damaging, however, are the accusations that Allen Dulles promised to prevent any postwar Allied retribution against the German officials involved in the surrender negotiations. After the German surrender, the Allies did not put Wolff on trial at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, although the Americans extensively interrogated him. The British then held him as a witness in the trial of Field Marshal Kesslering until 1949 and subsequently placed the SS general on trial in Hamburg. The British failed, however, to present a solid case against Wolff, and Wolff won an outright acquittal. The West German Government eventually filed its own charges against Wolff in 1962 when he was found guilty of being "continuously engaged and deeply entangled in guilt" for the crimes of the Third Reich. He received a 15-year prison sentence.

  Dollmann and Wenner. The case of General Wolff was the best known of troubles that faced the German participants involved in Operation SUNRISE. As new players and political forces emerged in postwar Europe and Washington, the US government agencies in contact with the former German officers multiplied-and in many cases these organizational shifts erased institutional memories. Eugen Dollmann and Eugen Wenner created problems for the Allies in the years after the war, with Dollmann remaining active in the intelligence arena in Europe for the next decade. After a lengthy confinement, Dollmann and Wenner escaped from an Allied prisoner of war camp in 1946. In August of that year, Capt. James J. Angleton, the head of SCIZ, the counterintelligence branch in Rome of the Strategic Services Unit (the successor to OSS), learned from Baron Luigi Parilli that Italian military intelligence had placed Dollmann and Wenner in custody in Milan. According to Parilli, a rightwing Italian faction planned to use both Germans to discredit the Allies." To forestall such a plot, Angleton managed to bring Dollmann and Wenner to Rome and provided them with false identities. He also urged the US Army to publish a "white paper" on Operation SUNRISE to counteract the attacks by Italian rightists and communists. The Italian police, however, arrested Dollmann, and he became caught up in an internal power struggle within the Italian bureaucracy. Angleton, in turn, tried to get Dollmann released from Italian custody. After learning about Dollmann's arrival in Rome, the Italian Communism press raised his name as a witness, or as a possible defendant, at the trial of Nazi officers involved in the German massacre of 335 Italian civilians in March 1944.

  The British and Americans in Rome could not agree whether Dollmann and Wenner had been offered any sort of immunity or protection as a result of their role in Operation SUNRISE. British Maj. Gen. Terence S. Airy, one of the two Allied generals who met with Wolff during the negotiations, denied that Dollmann played any role in the surrender proceedings. Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ), in turn, issued a press release to this effect, stating that it had Dollmann in custody after his escape from a British POW camp earlier in the year.' Angleton, however, continued to urge officials in Italy and in Washington to help Dollmann and Wenner, both of whom had since been transferred to an American military prison in Rome." In Washington, the Central Intelligence Group (CIG, successor to SSU) scrambled to find a way out of the mess. Chief of CIG's Control branch contacted the State Department to ascertain its views on the Dollmann-Wenner case. The Chief was told that "he was in agreement that the record should be kept clear in Italy and that we should not allow the Communists to undermine our position on a false set of facts, which could be cleared up by an official statement setting forth the truth with regard to Dollmann and Wenner." Walter Dowling, the head of the Italian Desk at the State Department and the official assigned to provide the Department's views on the case, told [redacted] that State felt that the US Government should not "protect" the two Germans. [redacted] also faced a problem of ascertaining whether the Allies had made any promises to Dollmann and Wenner during the negotiations. In researching the case for Lt. Gen. HoytS. Vandenburg, the Director of Central Intelligence, [redacted] Treviewed the 1946 British interrogation report of Dollmann as well as Dulles's 1945 report of Operation SUNRISE to see what information he could find. [redacted] determined that they had participated in the surrender negotiations "at no small risk." He found no evidence that either had received any commitments. Dulles himself confirmed to [redacted] that he had "made no promises or commitments to Dollmann or Wenner, nor did he authorize any other person to make such commitments." Dulles stated that "these men did participate in the negotiations and his feeling is that if they are in trouble that some effort should be made to help them." E agreed and told his superiors that "whether or not binding commitments were made to Dollmann or Wenner, it seems that we owe some consideration to these two men."

  On 27 November, Gen. Vandenburg cabled to Lt. Gen. John C.H. Lee, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean Theater and commanding general of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations United States Army (MTOUSA), stating that a review of the OSS operational records and discussions with both Allen Dulles and Maj. Gen. Lyman L. Lemnitzer, who had been the American general officer present during the SUNRISE talks, confirmed Dollmann's role in the surrender proceedings. The DCI told Gen. Lee that "it would appear that present representations by Italians is attempt to undermine Allied position in Italy and in view of the above facts and particularly the repercussions and results that any unjust treatment of these individuals would have on the future long-range United States intelligence activities in Italy." Following the recommendations offered by [redacted] Vandenburg stated that it would appear that Allied interests would best be served if AFHQ would confirm that Dollman(n] and Wenner participated in SUNRISE negotiations and show these individuals appropriate consideration in present circumstances." The DCI added that the State Department had no objection to this proposed course of action." Gen. Lee replied to Gen. Vandenberg on 29 November 1946. According to research that Lee had done in Italy, Lemnitzer and Airey, the two Allied generals who represented Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, during the meetings with Wolff had "had the strictest instruction not to offer any form of immunity or reward to any individual and only operate on the basis of unconditional surrender." Lee stated, "they scrupulously carried out their instructions." Any promises made by any other individual or party to the Germans ran counter to Eisenhower's orders. Gen. Lee categorically denied that Dollmann played any part in the negotiations and refused to release him, claiming such a step would "not help Dollmann and would create confusion with respect to Allied Force Headquarters position." The American commander noted that his headquarters had already offered Dollmann to the British as a witness and would hand him over to the Italians if an Italian court decided to press charges. "Since it is now known that Dollmann is held in United States custody, it would place Allied Force Headquarters in untenable position morally should it refuse request from Italian court that Dollman testif!" If and when legal proceedings subsided, Lee promised, the Army would then "repatriate Dollmann through normal United States channels."

  Lee's cable brought a sigh of relief in Washington. On 3 December, Vandenberg informed Lee that he "greatly appreciate[d] proposed action on Dollmann." Vandenburg, in turn, provided the Army in Italy with further information on Dollmann's role as an intermediary between Wolff and Dulles as well as in facilitating the release of the two Italian prisoners held by the Nazis. "Records and Mr. Allen Dulles confirm that no immunity in any form was offered to any individual involved in SUNRISE." By the end of December 1946, the Italians had not taken any steps to gain custody of either Dollmann or Wenner. Lee recommended that Dollmann be returned to Germany where the Army could detain him if the Italians decided to press criminal charges. It must also be noted that now historians have reached the consensus that, "Padre Pancrazio attested that Dollmann had gone to some risk in vainly seeking papal intervention to avert the Ardeatine Caves massacre."

  In 2005, the IWG, a team of world-leading historians) published a 2005 study that examined declassified records under the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. It concludes: "Some claims about vast conspiracies involving the American government and Nazi war criminals or the intelligence use of some big-name Nazis in the postwar period turned out to be completely unfounded. And legends and concoctions about certain high-level criminals such as Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo, whose fate remained obscure at the end of the war, flourished best in a climate of suspicion and secrecy. The opening of OSS, CIA, and FBI records on Müller will not sway those determined to believe in conspiracy theories, but they should convince those who are willing to base conclusions on the evidence." It further concludes, "Nor was there any conspiracy to protect Hitler's willing executioners." and, "The piles of new CIC, FBI, and CIA files reveal no overarching policy by which American intelligence agencies targeted known SS or Gestapo officers for hiring."<sup>[[9]](https://archive.org/details/usintelligencena0000unse)</sup></sup>

  The United States took the lead in the first grand experiment with postwar justice beginning with the International Trial of the Major War Criminals at Nuremberg in 1945 and 1946.' Following this landmark trial, the United States held twelve more trials in Nuremberg, which involved 144 high-level defendants from the German High Command, the medical profession, big business, the judiciary, government ministries, SS economic officials, and most notably, the Einsatzgruppen. More military trials were held of German camp personnel and others so that by 1949, the United States had tried more than 1,800 German suspects. The U.S. war criminal prison in Landsberg had roughly one thousand inmates and bore the official name War Criminal Prison Number 1 on the assumption that there would be a War Criminal Prison Number 2. The worst SS criminals were hanged as late as July 1951, despite the virtual sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Germany, despite mass West German protests at Landsberg prison, and despite the intercession of high-ranking West Germans who would be instrumental for the rearmament of West Germany and its military alignment with NATO.3 Only the Soviet Union tried more German personnel. But Soviet proceedings were often for violations of Soviet criminal codes and contained a strong air of show trials.* Other continental European states, including West European ones, generally tried Germans only for crimes committed against their own nationals.

  Thus the United States' judicial record was unique, innovative, and substantial. It was not the policy of a state sympathetic with nazism, indifferent to the Holocaust, or soft on war criminals."

- Between 1945-1947, the OSS, and later CIA—briefly, worked with Ukrainian emigre groups after WW2. In 1947, the Central Intelligence Group approved USSR's extradition request for Bandera (after initial resistance), as well as ceasing intelligence gathering contact with the OUN, because of "the increasingly totalitarian attitude taken by Bandera." Due to ethics concerns, "by the spring of 1947 Munich base had orders to stop its work with the various emigre groups, especially the Ukrainians." Thus, all ties to groups were cut. CIA conducted another study in 1948 on various Ukraine groups to support and found that ZPUHVR would be suitable because, "ZPUHVR leaders have demonstrated that they are not interested in personal gain or profit... and has as kept itself morally and politically uncommitted and uncompromised over a period of three years." It should also be noted that Lebed and Hrinioch broke with Bandera's OUN in 1948.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/STUDIES%20IN%20INTELLIGENCE%20NAZI%20-%20RELATED%20ARTICLES_0015.pdf)</sup></sup>

However, due to unforeseen issues such as the overwhelming numbers of German troop surrender, far more than planned—the Allied forces struggled to maintain sanitation conditions and other needs.

Middleton convened a general court-martial for both men. West was found guilty, sentenced to life in prison. Compton's men didn't face Court-martial, since they acted under the orders of Compton, per Field Manual (FM) 27-10, Rules of Land Warfare, "Individuals of the armed forces will not be punished for these offenses in case they are committed under orders or sanction of their government or commanders. The commanders ordering the commission of such acts, or under whose authority they are committed by their troops, may be punished by the belligerent into whose hands they may fall." However, this also provided a defense in Compton's case—as, he claimed he was acting under the orders of General Patton. General Patton was cleared of wrong-doing by a seperate IG investigation. His speech didn't order killing of POWs, however it was misinterpreted as such. Since Compton thought he was acting on orders in good faith.<sup>[[1]](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/03-2013.pdf)</sup></sup>

## Asia

- In 2004, the Toledo Blade ran a series detailing alleged war crimes committed by "Tiger Force" in Vietnam. On 3 Feb, 1971, a former member of the 101st Airborne Division reported that a number of personnel from the Tiger Force Recon Platoon committed war crimes in South Vietnam, 1967. The Blade's series generally just repeated  and editorialized the allegations. However, a 2004 review of the paper's allegations of inconsistencies with the ROI found, “are attributed to misrepresentation of the facts and testimonial evidence being taken out of context.” The original report found most war crime allegations made in '71 were without merit. However, some were unable to be proven/disproven—and a few were found to be credible. Many of the credible cases had no action taken because those implicated were KIA in 1967, or were unidentified.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/tiger-force)</sup></sup>


- Conspiracy theorists claim the US supported the communist Khmer Rouge. This is a long-exposed lie.

  Background: Prince Sihanouk’s efforts throughout the previous decade to keep Cambodia out of the war in Vietnam and walk a tightrope between superpowers had failed. In March 1970, while he vacationed in France, the National Assembly voted unanimously to withdraw its confidence from Prince Sihanouk. Lon Nol would become the new head of state and oversee the drafting of a new constitution. In October 1970, he proclaimed the Khmer Republic, with the removal of Vietnamese Communists from Cambodian lands at the center of its agenda. The Prince and the communist powers—the governments of North Vietnam, the Soviet Union and China—claimed that the CIA was behind the coup, while President Nixon and Henry Kissinger, then National Security Advisor, expressed surprise at the take-over, stating the United States was in no way involved. Indeed, it is confirmed the CIA had no role in any attempt.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP99-00418R000100090001-2.pdf#page=7)</sup></sup> The exiled Prince would go on to form a government in Paris called the Gouvernement Royal d’Union Nationale de Kampuchea, or GRUNK, while encouraging Cambodians to join the rising Khmer Rouge party. The United States military had become increasingly suspicious of the Prince and viewed him as an obstacle to its objectives in Southeast Asia. The trafficking of weapons and supplies for Vietnamese communists through the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville had long been an issue of concern, as were Sihanouk’s overtures to the North Vietnamese. Given these issues, the new regime in Cambodia was viewed as a positive change in the recently re-established diplomatic relations between the United States and Cambodia. The United States was quick to recognize and back Lon Nol’s government.

  The United States and Cambodia now shared the same goal: to get communist Vietnamese troops out of Cambodia. To this end, Lon Nol entered into an entente with the South Vietnamese, ending Cambodia’s long-time position of neutrality. In doing so, Cambodia officially began to fight the communists. But Lon Nol would not be the strong military leader Cambodia needed. Within the first few months of his rule, his Force Armée National Khmère, or FANK, would suffer major casualties and setbacks, desperately looking on as more than half of Cambodia fell to the North Vietnamese army. On April 30, 1970, President Nixon informed a shocked American public that U.S. and South Vietnamese troops were entering Cambodia in order to defeat the over 40,000 Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers that had amassed in the east of the country. Few people outside of the President’s circle knew about the plan, including Secretary of State William P. Rogers, who only five days earlier had testified to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations that the United States had no intention of intervening in Cambodia. The strategy, known as the Cambodia Campaign or Cambodia Incursion, had several aims: to upset the supply system to the Vietnamese communists, relieve pressure on U.S. and South Vietnamese soldiers in South Vietnam, facilitate the imminent withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam, and help rid Cambodia of the communist threat. Cambodia was no longer simply a sideshow in the Vietnam War; it was now part of it. The U.S. Embassy grew as U.S. military personnel arrived in Phnom Penh and U.S. forces provided significant air power to assist the Cambodians. But both the Department of Defense and the Embassy feared for Cambodia’s future. Lon Nol continued to be a weak leader, ineffectively managing the army and a government that seemed to be falling deeper and deeper into corruption and incompetence. The country needed a strong, central character that would win the war. As the situation in Phnom Penh continued to deteriorate, Lon Nol would become increasingly anti-democratic and begin violent crackdowns on student protests and labor strikes. When an election was called in the spring of 1972, the United States hoped that Lon Nol, who had recently suffered a stroke, would graciously bow out and a reform-minded group would assume power. Not only did Lon Nol run, but he won in an election that was widely believed to be rigged. Terror attacks continued from the communist Khmer Rouge. The 1972 Easter Offensive in Vietnam, during which the North Vietnamese launched a massive campaign against South Vietnamese and U.S. troops, represented a major turning point in the war in Cambodia. Key Vietnamese units withdrew from Cambodia to support the offensive. From this point forward, the Khmer Rouge became the leading force battling the Lon Nol government, though officials in Washington would continue to believe that the insurgent troops were still backed by the Vietnamese. The conflict in Cambodia had now become a civil war.

  A State Department report prepared in January of 1973 stated that the Cambodian government now controlled as little as a quarter of the country, and Lon Nol’s government had virtually no support. The same month saw the signing of the Paris Peace Accords, which ended direct U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. Fighting in Vietnam stopped temporarily, and there was momentary hope that the conflict would end in Cambodia. Though the accords reiterated Cambodia’s independence and neutrality as defined by the 1954 Geneva Convention, no timetable was set for a ceasefire in Cambodia. On the advice of the United States, which hoped to see an end to the wars in Indochina, Lon Nol called for a ceasefire. Meanwhile, Prince Sihanouk repeatedly tried to meet with Kissinger and discuss solutions for the failing Cambodian state. Kissinger mistrusted Sihanouk’s intentions and questioned his ties to the Khmer Rouge, and no talks were ever arranged. The conflict continued to escalate and it looked as though Phnom Penh might fall to the Khmer Rouge at any moment. But the troops were pushed back by U.S. bombings. At home, pressure was growing to end U.S. involvement in the civil war. Congress soon revoked all funds for military involvement in Cambodia, forcing President Nixon to end all air support in mid-August of 1973. Ambassador Swank, who was by now critical of the ongoing war, was relieved of his post. On April 3, 1974, John Gunther Dean presented his credentials and took on the daunting task of trying to salvage the increasingly hopeless situation in the country, which was now largely controlled by the Khmer Rouge. With U.S. support gone, the Lon Nol government focused its efforts on holding onto Phnom Penh for as long as it could. Ambassador Dean urged for a controlled solution, which inevitably involved the United States negotiating with Khmer Rouge leaders. That way, he reasoned, the United States would at least have some influence over the fate of the country. Ambassador Dean also urged Washington to open direct talks with Prince Sihanouk. But Kissinger, who was now Secretary of State, dismissed the urgency of Dean’s pleas, and did not pursue diplomatic channels. By the time he came around to the idea in 1975, the Khmer Rouge was within weeks of total victory.

  After President Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, the Cambodia issue fell to President Gerald Ford. The administration continued to ask Congress to support Cambodia. President Ford did manage to secure a congressional, bipartisan fact-finding mission to visit Cambodia in March 1975. Stunned by the devastation, virtually all the participants returned with the intention of restoring aid to Cambodia. But it was too late. The Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh on April 17. Thirteen days later, Saigon fell. In the five years of civil war that had consumed Cambodia, 500,000 people died. But this would only be the beginning of the bloodshed in Cambodia. Under the leadership of Saloth Sar, a long-time political rival of Lon Nol who had taken the revolutionary name Pol Pot, cities were emptied and residents were driven into the countryside. The new Democratic Kampuchea would become one of the most savage, secretive regimes in the world, maintaining ties only with North Korea and China. Little would be known about the atrocities that would ensue in the next four years, which would see nearly two million people, or a fifth of the population, perish. A report generated in 1974 by Foreign Service Officer Kenneth Quinn, provided a stark portrayal of the Khmer Rouge’s true nature. While stationed along the South Vietnamese border for nine months between 1973 and 1974, Quinn had interviewed countless Cambodian refugees who had escaped the brutal clutches of the Khmer Rouge. He learned that the regime abolished private property and collectivized all goods, imposed forced relocations, separated families, and classified all people as peasants, workers, or soldiers. Education was highly suspect; wearing glasses was a crime worthy of execution. Minorities were persecuted. Work would be the only acceptable pastime. Quinn’s assessment foreshadowed the country’s fate.

  After over 15 years of involvement in Indochina, and at great cost in American lives, the United States was ready to move on. Crises in the Middle East would occupy the administration of President Jimmy Carter. Though human rights stood at the center of his political agenda, the situation in Cambodia was not a priority. There would be some debate about the U.S. responsibility to Cambodia—most notably on the part of Representative Stephen Solarz, who would become the most informed congressmen on the issue. In 1978, President Carter issued  statement condemning the actions of the Democratic Kampuchea government and, importantly, used the word ‘genocide’ in his statement. The same year, legislation was passed that allowed 15,000 Cambodian refugees to settle in the United States. In response to increased Khmer Rouge incursions into Vietnamese territory, Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in December 1978. In January, 1979 the Khmer Rouge fled Phnom Penh and Pol Pot was forced to retreat to northwestern Cambodia. Given Vietnam’s recent alignment with the Soviet Union, the United States condemned the invasion, viewing it as an expansion of Soviet influence in Southeast Asia. Improving the relationship between the United States and Cambodia would have to wait.

  At the start of the 1980s, very little of Cambodia’s infrastructure remained intact. Few roads, schools or hospitals had survived Khmer Rouge rule, and most civil servants and educated people had either died or fled the country. Famine was rife. Food stocks were dwindling due to disruptions in the harvest cycle caused by the invasion of Vietnamese troops, 150,000 of whom would remain in Cambodia for most of the decade. Some 300,000 Cambodian refugees lived in UN-administered camps along the Thai border, but only 10% were given refugee status, meaning the vast majority would spend the decade in limbo. International development groups, responding to the misery of the camps, poured into the border area to begin administering aid. The United States contributed $15 million per year in humanitarian assistance through organizations such as UNICEF and the International Committee for the Red Cross. As early as 1981, this aid began to have an impact on conditions in the camps, with the malnutrition rate among children falling from 50% to 2.5% in less than a year.

  The allegation: U.S. policy throughout the decade was to end Vietnamese military involvement in Cambodia and replace the Vietnamese-backed People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) government with one that represented the will of the people. To that end, the United States, under the Reagan and Bush administrations, supported political and popular resistance to the PRK government, which was headed by Khmer Rouge defectors. The anti-government resistance along the border was composed of three groups, which officially joined together in 1982 to create the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). The largest of these was the Khmer Rouge, which received military aid from China through Thailand. Although critics charged that U.S. humanitarian aid was unintentionally reaching the Khmer Rouge, the United States denied this. The United States did directly support the two other groups, dubbed collectively the non-communist resistance, with non-lethal aid. Prince Norodom Sihanouk headed the pro-royalist National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), while Son Sann, a Prime Minister in the 1960s, headed the Khmer People’s National Liberation Front (KPNLF). The only evidence cited for the allegation stems from a single letter that was debunked. "Since the fall of 1986 we have received reports about a letter from a Congressional Staffer alleging USG support for the Khmer Rouge. The letter was written by Jonathan Winer, counsel to Senator Kerry, and contained what were purported to be figures on annual USG support for the Khmer rouge starting in 1980. Winer claimed in his letter that the information on USG support was received from the Congressional Research Service (CRS). The allegation and figures included in Winer's letter are completely without basis in fact. The USG abhors and condemns the Khmer rouge and has never provided any direct assistance to them. We have, however, generously supported the relief program for displaced Cambodians on the Thai border. We also assist the Cambodian noncommunist resistance forces led by Prince Sihanouk and Son Sann in their struggle against the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. We have initiated stringent safeguards in both programs to ensure that the assistances does not end up with the Khmer Rouge. The Congressional Research Service has denied any knowledge of the information attributed to it."<sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120133711/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90M00005R001000080038-7.pdf)</sup></sup>

  As noted by leading journalist, Nate Thayer, who reported for AP out of Bangkok, Thailand, "The United States has scrupulously avoided any direct involvement in aiding the Khmer Rouge." He details US aid to non-communist groups, detailing how these groups frequently fought with the Khmer Rouge. He also notes from his field experience, "In months spent in areas controlled by the three resistance groups and during scores of encounters with the Khmer Rouge... I never once encountered aid given to the non-communist resistance in use by or in possession of the Khmer Rouge."<sup>[[3]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01636609109477687)</sup></sup>

  On the UN: It has also been alleged that the US "supported" the Khmer Rouge's seat at the UN, however, it's more nuanced than that, and also wrong. Beginning in 1979, and continuing throughout the 1980s, the United States – along with China, ASEAN and others – voted to allow the anti-government coalition to hold Cambodia’s seat at the United Nations. The United States argued that the PRK government was illegitimate since it was imposed by a foreign invasion, and it was consistent with international law to seat the predecessor government. US Government's position was that a country should not be deprived of representation at the United Nations simply because other Governments dislike that country's politics or find it morally objectionable. However, it welcomed the opportunity if a Supreme National Council was formed in time to present credentials for the next session of the UN General Assembly. The US tried to pressure Khmer Rouge out of the coalition government. In February and March of 1985, U.S. Representative Stephen Solarz, a Democrat from New York with a keen interest in developments in Cambodia, attempted to change the nature of U.S. support for these groups. Solarz proposed a $5 million package of overt, non-lethal aid; direct U.S. support for the groups up to that point had been covert and non-lethal, at $12 million per year. On May 15, the Senate approved a version of Solarz’ proposal. The House of Representatives then voted to pass the legislation in July, and President Reagan signed the bill on August 8, 1985. For the first time, U.S. non-lethal aid to the non-communist resistance would be overt, reaching a total of $15 million over the next three years. As U.S. aid to the non-communist resistance increased in size and visibility, the Vietnamese government began to realize that it could no longer afford its costly occupation of Cambodia. Convinced that the PRK could resist a Khmer Rouge takeover without outside help, Vietnam announced in 1988 that it was planning to withdraw its forces from the country. In February 1989, negotiations were held in Indonesia. Following the meeting, the PRK announced that Vietnam would withdraw by the end of September 1989, even if a political agreement was not reached. On September 21, 1989, Vietnam began its final withdrawal of troops from Cambodia. However, Cambodia remained divided, and the United States joined the international community in a final push to end the conflict. In October 1989, Representative Solarz conferred with Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans about administering the country and holding elections. The following month, Evans presented his plan, which included significant input from Solarz and Prince Sihanouk. Evans’ proposal called for the UN to provide interim authority until national elections could be held. The stage was set for the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia – the most expensive peacekeeping effort undertaken by the UN – and Cambodia’s first democratic elections.

  Transition: When the 1990s began, Cambodia was still a country divided by civil war, yet by the end of the decade it would finally see an end to nearly 30 years of armed conflict. The country would reach several milestones during the period: it would hold its first democratic elections, it would witness the demise of the Khmer Rouge as a military and political force, and it would welcome the return of Prince Norodom Sihanouk to Phnom Penh after 13 years in exile. U.S. relations with Cambodia improved steadily over the course of the 1990s, culminating in the reestablishment of diplomatic relations and the re-instatement of U.S. development assistance. These changes came about largely because of major shifts in the geopolitical landscape and persistent negotiations by all of the parties with a stake in Cambodia’s future.  On January 2, 1990, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker asked the five permanent members of the UN SecurityCouncil—to convene on the Cambodia issue. A series of meetings followed in New York and Paris. The U.S. position in these talks was that the UN should have authority over Cambodia during a transition period that would precede national elections and the formation of a new government. All five countries involved in the talks agreed to a plan that would see Prime Minister Hun Sen’s government retain control of its technical agencies but transfer administration of its ministries to the UN. At a second meeting in New York in February, the five permanent members discussed disarming the various warring factions, but a peace deal remained elusive.  In March 1990, the UN unveiled the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). It would be the largest and most ambitious UN peacekeeping operation up to that point, with an estimated price tag of $1.5 billion. The plan laid out general outlines for an election, and it included the stipulation that refugees must be present in Cambodia to vote. Meanwhile, a major debate was taking place in the U.S. Congress about President George H.W. Bush’s policy toward Cambodia. Representative Chester Atkins, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, a Democrat from Maine, criticized the Bush policy of supporting the non-communist resistance. The Congressmen contended that supporting the resistance groups was immoral because they were part of a coalition that included the Khmer Rouge. Atkins took his argument to a national audience on a special ABC News report by Peter Jennings on April 26, 1990. During the program, Atkins made the case that the United States was tolerating the Khmer Rouge and that this policy could result in the communist rebels returning to power. “We’re still fighting the Vietnam War, and this is the last battle of that war, and if we have to use the Khmer Rouge as a pawn in that we’ll use them,” he said. “We don’t appreciate that we’re being used by the Khmer Rouge rather than the other way around.” Seizing the momentum, in June Atkins proposed an amendment to cut all aid to the anti-government resistance and instead provide $10 million in support of peace talks.

  Representative Stephen Solarz, a Democrat from New York long engaged in the Cambodia issue, argued against the amendment, contending that no U.S. support had reached the Khmer Rouge. A large majority of members of the U.S. House of Representatives agreed and voted down the amendment. Regardless, the U.S. Senate entered the debate. Senator Mitchell and Senator John Danforth, a Republican from Missouri, demanded that the anti-government resistance be removed from Cambodia’s UN seat, and that the United States start providing humanitarian aid to Cambodia, open talks with the Phnom Penh government, and state publicly that the Khmer Rouge should have no role in Cambodia’s future. A petition that the senators created containing these demands collected more than 60 signatures in Congress. As a result of this public pressure, the administration reexamined and, ultimately, changed its position. On July 18, 1990, Secretary Baker announced at a news conference that the United States would do everything it could to ensure that the Khmer Rouge never returned to power in Cambodia. In addition, Secretary Baker said that the United States would begin providing aid to Cambodia outside of the border refugee camps, open dialogue with Hun Sen and Vietnam, and reverse its policy of supporting the anti-government resistance occupying Cambodia’s UN seat. This shift in U.S. policy set the stage for a final settlement in August 1990. On August 27 and 28, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council drafted a framework document that called for all parties to endorse a Cambodian Supreme National Council (SNC) that would have Prince Sihanouk as its head and would represent the various factions. It also called for a ceasefire and laid out guidelines for an election. The anti-government resistance and Hun Sen accepted the framework at a meeting in Jakarta in September. However, a cease fire did not occur in practice.

  In February 1991, China announced that it would resume military aid to the Khmer Rouge. The United States, in an effort to assure the international community that it would not tolerate the return of Pol Pot to power, suspended all aid to the non-communist resistance because of its cooperation with the Khmer Rouge. In June 1991, the SNC and the five permanent members of the Security Council met again but still could not convince the Khmer Rouge – who continued to initiate military offensives against government troops from their strongholds along the Thai border – to accept a peace settlement. The next month, the SNC met in Beijing and agreed to stop receiving arms from foreign sources and to allow the UN to monitor a tentative ceasefire.

  The long-awaited diplomatic breakthrough finally occurred in October 1991. At what was dubbed the Paris Conference, all parties signed an historic peace accord. Under the agreement, UNTAC would take charge of the resettlement of 350,000 Cambodian refugees along the Thai border; disarmament of the various factions; preparations for a democratic election; and re-establishment of government institutions. On November 11, the United States opened a liaison office in Phnom Penh and appointed Charles H. Twining as U.S. Representative. The United States also announced that it would end economic sanctions and begin providing aid to Cambodia for the first time in 15 years. By 1992, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) would re-open its permanent mission to Cambodia, and the agency’s total budget for the decade would reach $264 million. With the establishment of a full-scale mission, USAID focused on rebuilding roads destroyed during 30 years of fighting and meeting the basic humanitarian needs of the Cambodian people. Improved health and education services emerged as additional key concerns. U.S. .assistance also paid for 30% of UNTAC’s budget and supported UNTAC’s mandate of establishing a freely elected government. Although a new government was in place, fears again surfaced in 1994 that the Khmer Rouge would re-emerge as a force in Cambodia. In response, the United States sent advisors to assist the Cambodian military, and the United States also protested Thailand’s continued support of the Khmer Rouge. Although the Khmer Rouge continued to worry the international community, U.S. assistance was a major factor in slowly weakening the rebels. According to many experts, the U.S. focus on building and refurbishing roads helped undermine the Khmer Rouge because it ended the isolation of populations living in areas the rebels controlled.<sup>[[4]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/t-nsiad-90-63.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://kh.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/book_us_cambodia_relations.pdf#page=30)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137364098_5)</sup></sup>
 
- There has been an increasing number of US veterans alleging exposure to Herbicide Orange while serving at military installations in Okinawa during the Vietnam Era. Some specific allegations published by the The Japan Times and other news outlets: Herbicide Orange and tactical herbicides were tested and evaluated in the jungle areas of Okinawa in 1961 – 1962; Beginning in 1962 in Project AGILE, Herbicide Orange and other tactical herbicides were shipped to or through, unloaded on, or used in Okinawa by the US Department of Defense during the Vietnam War; Shipments of the remaining surplus inventory of “25,000 barrels” of Herbicide Orange from Vietnam were sent to Okinawa prior to shipment to Johnston Island in 1971 during Operation RED HAT; Large quantities of Herbicide Orange were buried “in and around Chatan Town at Hamby Air Field” , and/or “buried at White Beach near the Machinato Supply Depot (Service Area)”, and/or “buried near the Futenma Air Station near the city of Ginowan”; Numerous US Vietnam-era veterans stationed in Okinawa handled and sprayed Herbicide Orange, or were witnesses to it being sprayed by a C-123; and, Some veterans stationed at Kadena Air Base cleaned the C-123 aircraft contaminated from spraying Herbicide Orange. However, an independent, comprehensive investigation concluded, "after an extensive search of all known and available records, there were no documents found that validated the allegations that Herbicide Orange was involved in any of these events, nor were there records to validate that Herbicide Orange was shipped to or through, unloaded, used or buried on Okinawa."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111003/http://denix.osd.mil/shf/upload/Allegations-of-Herbicide-Orange-on-Okinawa-January-2013.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Between 1964 and 1975, it is claimed that the US bombing campaign led to a poverty trap in Vietnam. However, the academic literature disputes this unfounded claim.

- It is charged by political pundits that the US Military during the Vietnam war, the stratergy was strategy of civilian slaughter sanctioned by American leaders—not only is this contradicted by the Rules of Engagement, as detailed in the following sections—but as  Fred L. Borch, a Military Historian & Archivist finds, "The vast majority of professional historians reject this view; they do not find that the historical record supports the conclusion that war crimes resulted from institutional flaws in the Army and its culture. In his highly acclaimed America in Vietnam, political scientist Guenter Lewy examined American strategy and tactics in Vietnam between 1961 and 1975, and analyzed hundreds of after action reports of military operations, command directive, field reports, and staff studies of pacification efforts. He also looked at courts-martial records and war crimes investigations. Lewy concluded that “charges of officially condoned illegal and grossly illegal conduct are without substance.” As Lewy demonstrates, the Army did not ignore misconduct by its Soldiers. On the contrary, the Army “kept statistics on the number of [war crimes] allegations made and their disposition.” For Lewy, this was proof that the Army as an institution was not turning a blind eye to war crimes committed by Americans in uniform. In Vietnam, senior commanders in fact took their responsibilities under the law of armed conflict seriously."<sup>[[1]](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/america-in-vietnam-9780195027327?cc=cz&lang=en&#)</sup></sup>

  In Law at War: Vietnam 1964-1973, an official study published by the Army’s Center of Military History, author George S. Prugh explains that the Commander, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), considered creating special war crimes teams (to both investigate and prosecute these offenses). Ultimately, however, General William C. Westmoreland decided that this was not needed since the laws prohibiting war crimes were clear and the administrative and judicial machinery for investigating and punishing such offenses was sufficient. Westmoreland did, however, establish detailed rules governing the investigation of war crimes. Of particular importance is MACV Directive 20-4, which not only required the reporting of any war crime alleged to have been committed by U.S. personnel, but made it a criminal offense to fail to make such report. Finally, it was American military lawyers in Vietnam who were responsible for convincing their South Vietnamese counterparts that the 1949 Geneva Conventions were applicable to the conflict (thereby ensuring that international law governed the treatment of enemy combatants), and that it was Army lawyers who, intent on complying with the Conventions, authored rules governing the treatment of detained persons, including innocent civilians and civil defendants."<sup>[[2]](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llmlp/law-at-war/law-at-war.pdf)</sup></sup> 

  In 1973, Mr. Gerald Greven and Robert Dickey, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, alleged that US forces bombed a hospital around April-May 1969, in war zone D, South Vietnam, and that attacking hospitals was condoned. However, several reviews into the allegation found no evidence, and indeed—only information to the contrary, concluding, "It was United States , MACV, and Service policy to adhere to the laws of war, including not only the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Convention, but also those found in Hague Conventions Number IV and those established by customary international law. In addition, specific restrictions were imposed on our forces in South Vietnam that went beyond these Conventions. These restrictions, imposed to minimize civilian casualties, reduce the chance of an inadvertent strike into an inhabited area, protect religious monuments, public buildings, and areas of cultural interest, were applicable to forces in the field and to all levels of command in the target selection process. The policies of the Services do not support a conclusion that bombing of hospitals or other facilities protected by the Geneva Conventions would be condoned. On the contrary, we may have suffered additional casualties because of our self-imposed restrictions."<sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/hospital-bombing-investigation-Nam)</sup></sup>

Allegations that it was used to harm/kill combatants or civilians is false.<sup>[[3]](https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/98481.pdf)</sup></sup> The US did deploy one of its agents briefly_ to target _few, select_ crops belonging to the viet cong.

The supposed evidence is a Rand report, according to the filing. However: The Rand report doesn't mention TCDD anywhere. The report also does not examine the toxicity of the only compound mentioned,  2,4-d. It's a survey of defectors, who report on what they believe to be the impact of various tactics.

- Napalm, Cluster munitions and other incendiary bombs were used in Vietnam. Their deployment was subject to careful approval on select military targets only, and after CIVCAS mitigation efforts were completed, thus satisfactory to the Geneva Conventions. Interestingly, "Available factual data suggest that the air delivery of the fire bomb on the target can be accomplished with extreme accuracy in close air support of troops on the ground. Far example, fire bombs in this role are generally dropped from an altitude of 50-350 feet when the attack aircraft is not further than 1,000 feet from the target. Delivery accuracy under typical conditions is said to be within 100 feet with an area of effectiveness, elliptical in shape, approximately 120 meters long and 25 meters wide. Alternative weapons are indicated as having substantially larger maximum effective areas, thus tending to disprove the contention that the fire bomb is a weapon with an unusually large area of effectiveness with attendant indiscriminate effects against civilians and civilian property."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20220131094000/https://tjaglcspublic.army.mil/documents/27431/2251871/View+the+PDF/ee82f732-b0b4-4275-b230-5be04ad16474#page=101)</sup></sup>  

- In July 1972, the Hanoi propaganda effort ramped up, claiming the US deliberately attacked several Dikes, causing civilian casualties. However, an independent, internal review confirmed this not to be the case. "A study of available photography shows conclusively that there has been no concerted and intentional bombing of North Vietnam's vital dike system. A few dikes have been hit, apparently by stray bombs directed at military-associated targets nearby. The observable damage is minor and no major dike has been breached."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85T00875R001700040062-8.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Between 1965 and 1971, US bombing of Cambodia, such as MENU, with Cambodian consent to stop Viet Cong forces from operating within the territory, resulted in only 343 civilian deaths and 639 wounded, according to a JSC study.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/LOC-HAK-449-5-3-5.pdf)</sup></sup> It is also argued by some that the Communist attack on civilians in Saigon on June 7, 1969 were retalitory for US bombing their forces in Cambodia.

There is no doubt that most of those casualties occurred in 1973. Pol Pot’s forces laid siege to Phnom Penh while cease-fire agreements in Vietnam and Cambodia permitted American air power to focus on Cambodia. Reporters in Phnom Penh could see that many nearby villages had been destroyed by bombing. According to the American air commander, General Vogt, those villages had already been vacated by civilians fleeing into the city. His forces were using a range of intelligence sources (including infrared sensors) to determine which villages were occupied. The worst error occurred at Neak Luong, where more than a hundred civilians were killed when a B-52 crew failed to calculate an offset and dropped on a beacon in the town.<sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/us-mil-doc-excerpts)</sup></sup>

  Arc light missions in Cambodia adhered to the laws of war, under strict ROE to protect civilians.

Aircraft were to withdraw if ground fire were received from the restricted area... The restricted list was further expanded by the FANK representatives on 28 June.

- Operation Linebacker 1, from May 9 to October 23, 1972 and Operation Linebacker 2, from December 18 to December 29, 1972 were bombing campaigns against North Vietnam. An independent study finds, "The Linebacker campaigns were conducted in full compliance with the prohibition on direct attacks against civilian populations and civilian objects. No orders were given to aircrews to attack civilians or civilian structures. On the contrary, during Linebacker I, the JCS instructed local commanders to take reasonable precautions to minimize incidental Wvilian casualties and avoid collateral damage to civilian structures. Similarly, in its message initiating Linebacker II, the JCS specifically directed the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific, and the Commander-in-Chief, Strategic Air Command. to "exercise precaution to minimize risk of civilian casualties.... " These instructions clearly demonstrate an intent to avoid--not to inflict--civilian casualties and destruction of civilian objects. This intention to avoid civilian casualties and destruction of civilian structures is reflected in the results of the campaigns, particularly Linebacker II in which B-52s were used in heavy raids in the Hanoi and Haiphong areas. These raids led to strident charges of "carpet bombing" and "barbarism" by Hanoi and the U.S. media and antiwar activists. Such charges notwithstanding, actual civilian casualties in the Hanoi and Haiphong areas were very low. North Vietnam reported a total of 1,318 people killed in Hanoi between December 18 and December 29, 1972. In Haiphong, 305 people were killed. The Hanoi casualties amount to only 0.08 deaths per ton of bombs dropped on the city. The casualties in Hanoi and Haiphong were also low in comparison to the 25,000 South Vietnamese killed during the first weeks of the March 1972 offensive by the North Vietnamese, who deliberately shelled large crowds of fleeing refugees. 

  During Linebacker I, one of the criteria used in target selection was minimum possibility of incidental civilian casualties and collateral damage. Each potential target was carefully evaluated using aerial photography and other means of intelligence. If the evaluation resulted in a determination that the target could not be attacked without high risk of collateral damage, the target was either designated for attack with smart bombs or rejected. Final approval of all targets thus screened was made by General Vogt, Commander, 7th Air Force As the campaign progressed, bomb-damage assessments were made, not only to verify the success of missions, but also to ensure that targeting and other operational restrictions were being adhered to. An attempt was made through post-strike photography to locate bomb impact points and account for every bomb dropped—even duds. Similar precautions were taken during Linebacker II. Potential targets had to be precisely identified as military objectives and even then might not be placed on the validated target list if there was a likelihood of excessive collateral damage. For example, some three days into the campaign, Air Force Intelligence located suspected SAM storage sites, which it asked JCS to authorize as targets. JCS refused to authorize one of the sites because it was located in a heavily populated section of Hanoi and because its identity as a storage site was not completely certain.

  Damage to civilian objects was also limited, contrary again to North Vietnamese propaganda and charges by the U.S. media and antiwar groups, which attempted to portray collateral damage as evidence of direct attacks on civilian structures. Perhaps the most well-known of these facilities was the Bach Mai Hospital, a 940-bed complex of buildings located less than 1,500 feet from two lawful military targets in the Hanoi area: Bach Mai Airfield and Bach Mai military storage facility. Though not targeted for attack, despite the emplacement of antiaircraft guns on its grounds to protect the nearby airfield and storage complex, the hospital was, nevertheless, inadvertently damaged by bombs that were scattered when a B-52 was hit by two SAMs. Aerial photographs show, however, that although some buildings were hit, there was clearly insufficient damage to support one report that the hospital had been "blown to smithereens, blown to bits, completely destroyed."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA191278/page/n1/mode/2up)</sup></sup>
 
   A scholarly paper from W. Hays Park, a world-leading LOAC expert, also confirms these operations were in compliance with international law, and details the efforts to mitigate collateral damage and civilian casualties. He concludes, "Both Linebacker campaigns were also conducted with an acute awareness by the military of its responsibilities under the law of war, with mission parameters well within the prohibitions of the law. Although unprecedented in the degree of precaution taken by an attacker to minimize collateral injury to the civilian population of an enemy, each campaign was successful in attaining its objectives."<sup>[[2]](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/ASPJ/journals/1983_Vol34_No1-6/1983_Vol34_No2.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- The US did not assist Pakistan militarily (overtly or covertly), during the 1971 Pakistan internal strike—which gave creation to Bangladesh. The US held in abeyance any sales, and suspended issuance of new additional expert licenses, or renew those expired—further, held on delivery from defense stocks.<sup>[[1]](https://ia800400.us.archive.org/17/items/milsale-pak-70/MilsalePak70.pdf)</sup></sup> The US engaged in a massive humanitarian aid program to both India.<sup>[[2]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-173651-096575.pdf)</sup></sup> and Pakistan<sup>[[3]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-173651-096593.pdf)</sup></sup> to stop as much suffering as a result of the internal strife. Further, the International Commission of Jurists found there was no genocide as it relates to Bengal. "To prevent a nation from attaining political autonomy does not constitute genocide: the intention must be to destroy in whole or in part the people as such. The Bengali people number some 75 million. It can hardly be suggested that the intention was to destroy the Bengali people. As to the destruction of part of the Bengali people, there can be no doubt that very many Bengalis were killed. We find it quite impossible to assess the total numbers, and we cannot place great confidence in the various estimates which have been made from time to time. However, it appears to be indubitable that the killed are to be numbered in tens of thousands and probably in hundreds of thousands. But this in itself is not sufficient to establish that the intent was to kill them simply because they belonged to the Bengali people as such."<sup>[[4]](https://web.archive.org/web/20140222191910/http://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ICJ-Review-8-1972-eng.pdf#page=36)</sup></sup>

  It should be noted that the Blood telegram was also refuted by its flaws of its assumptions. Its only positive was it helped create the "dissent channel" in the State Department. <sup>[[5]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve07/d129)</sup></sup> However, due to the complexities of diplomacy, I'll quote extensively from the State Department Office of the Historian summary of events: "The trigger for the crisis in 1971 in East Pakistan was the announcement by President Yahya Khan on March 1 that the scheduled meeting of the recently elected National Assembly would be postponed indefinitely. The National Assembly was scheduled to draft a new constitution for Pakistan to mark an end to martial law government. Because of the overwhelming electoral success in East Pakistan of Bengali nationalists, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his Awami League, the constitution was also expected to reflect their demand for virtual autonomy for East Pakistan. The Consulate General in Dacca reported on March 2 that "It would be impossible to over-estimate the sense of anger, shock and frustration which has gripped the east wing" as a result of the announcement.  President Yahya's announcement was followed by demonstrations in East Pakistan, and on March 7 Mujibur Rahman called for a "peaceful non-cooperation" movement patterned on Mahatma Gandhi's passive resistance movement in India. The martial law government responded by airlifting troops to Dacca to double the size of the 15,000-man garrison. Undaunted, Mujibur Rahman announced on March 15 that, on the basis of the December election, his party, the Awami League, was taking over the administration of East Pakistan.  On March 25, the army arrested Mujibur and moved to suppress what was viewed in Islamabad as a secessionist movement. The initial reaction in Washington to the emerging crisis was to avoid involvement in the internal politics of Pakistan. When the National Security Council's (NSC) Senior Review Group members considered the situation on March 6 they agreed with Under Secretary of State U. Alexis Johnson that it called for "massive inaction" on the part of the United States. That conclusion was confirmed on March 26 when the NSC's crisis management team, the Washington Special Actions Group (WSAG), considered the crisis for the first time. Kissinger led a discussion in which there was general agreement to maintain a hands-off policy toward what was viewed as a developing civil war. The United States did not want to be open to the charge that it had encouraged the break-up of Pakistan.

  On April 6, most members of the Consulate General in Dacca signed a dissent channel message to Washington. The message called upon the United States Government to condemn the "indiscriminate killing" of the populace of East Pakistan by the army. Condemnation of genocide, they argued, should outweigh a reluctance to intervene in the internal affairs of another country. Consul General Archer Blood endorsed the dissent.  In Washington, Secretary of State Rogers raged over the "miserable" cable from Dacca.  Kissinger told Nixon on April 12 that the " Dacca consulate is in open rebellion." Nixon again concluded that it would be a mistake to become involved: "The people who bitch about Vietnam bitch about it because we intervened in what they say is a civil war. Now some of the same bastards...want us to intervene here—both civil wars." As early as April 12, a Special National Intelligence Estimate, produced at Department of State request, concluded that prospects were "poor" that the Pakistani army would be able to exert effective control over East Pakistan. The estimate also concluded that India would foster and support Bengali insurgency and contribute to the likelihood that an independent Bangladesh would emerge from the developing conflict.  There were few illusions in Washington from an early stage in the crisis about the probable outcome of the civil war. At most, Yahya Khan and his government could hope to negotiate a settlement premised upon autonomy for East Pakistan within a loosely unified state. With authorization from Washington, United States officials encouraged efforts by representatives of the Awami League operating out of Calcutta, who styled themselves the new government of Bangladesh, to negotiate such a compromise settlement. There was an inclination within the U.S. Government, particularly within the Department of State, to bring pressure on the Government of Pakistan to restrain the army and establish a regional civil administration that might win back some Bengali support and halt the flow of refugees. Nixon's response was given in a handwritten instruction: "To all hands. Don't squeeze Yahya at this time." Why was Nixon so concerned not to squeeze Yahya? On May 7, Kissinger entertained Ambassador Joseph Farland on Nixon's instructions in Palm Springs, California, where Farland had gone under guise of personal business to meet privately with Kissinger. Kissinger told Farland that for some time he had been sending messages to China through the Pakistani Government without the knowledge of Farland or anyone in his embassy. Farland was made privy to the exchange in order to prepare for Kissinger's trip to China via Pakistan in July. Only Farland was to know about the cover Pakistan was providing for this initiative, or that President Yahya had facilitated it with the Chinese leaders.

  On May 13, Prime Minister Gandhi wrote to President Nixon about the "carnage in East Bengal" which "disturbed the Indian people deeply." She added that the impact of millions of refugees imposed an enormous burden upon India and impacted heavily upon its economy. There were by Indian count over 2 million refugees in West Bengal and the flow was increasing. The situation, she warned, could become explosive. Indian Ambassador L. K. Jha warned Kissinger on May 21 that without evidence that Pakistan would reverse the military repression and restore the political rights of the population of East Pakistan, there was strong support in India for the idea of arming the refugees and sending them back as guerrillas.  By the end of May, reports were coming to Washington about Indian forces gathering along the border with East Pakistan. The United States passed the word to India that it was opposed to military intervention in the civil war. Nixon said that if India intervened militarily "by God we will cut off economic aid."  In a subsequent conversation with Kissinger on May 26, Nixon said that "the goddamn Indians" were promoting another war. Kissinger agreed: "they are the most aggressive goddamn people around."

  Nixon and Kissinger, who managed the United States response to the crisis... met in Washington in June with Indian Foreign Minister Swaran Singh and attempted to persuade him that the civil war need not evolve into conflict between India and Pakistan. When Nixon met with Singh on June 16, he tried to defuse the crisis by offering $70 million in humanitarian assistance to help offset the expenses involved in dealing with the refugees. Singh, who expanded on the "tremendous problems" created for India by the often destitute refugees, expressed appreciation for the offer but insisted that the fundamental question was how to stop the flow of refugees. It would not be possible, he said, to "buy the problem away." Nixon's view of the emerging crisis was expressed in an NSC meeting on July 16. The Indians... he felt that they would like nothing more than to take advantage of the opportunity to destroy Pakistan. Kissinger agreed that India seemed bent upon war. He thought that China would enter any such war on Pakistan's side, but concluded that might not dissuade India. Kissinger felt that if the United States did not "over-power the question of war, India would slide into it." On August 3, Secretary Rogers sent telegrams to New Delhi and Islamabad expressing concern about cross-border shelling by both Indian and Pakistani forces in East Pakistan and Indian support for Bengali guerrillas being infiltrated into East Pakistan. He instructed the embassies to urge restraint in the face of the strong possibility of war.

  Reports reached Washington in early October that Indian and Pakistani artillery were massing along the border of East Pakistan. The expectation was that the coming end of the monsoon season would create the conditions necessary for offensive operations and could bring the crisis to a head. The embassies in New Delhi and Islamabad were instructed to urge that cross-border operations be prevented. On October 8, Kissinger warned Ambassador Jha that if India started a war the United States would cut off all economic assistance. On the same day, Ambassador Beam called on Gromyko to emphasize U.S. concern about the mounting danger of war. The United States tried in mid-October to build on Foreign Minister Singh's assurance that India would not initiate hostilities by proposing that both sides withdraw their forces from the border to the nearest military bases. Pakistan accepted the proposal but India hedged and said that such a move would leave India at a disadvantage in that Pakistan's bases were closer to the border. Nixon put this proposal to Indira Gandhi when she visited Washington on November 4 as part of her tour of foreign capitals to try to generate support for India's position. He also told her that the United States would find the initiation of hostilities between India and Pakistan to be totally unacceptable. In a stiff meeting, Gandhi denied sponsoring the Mukti Bahini guerrillas and denied that Indian forces were poised to initiate a conflict. In this and in their subsequent meeting on the following day, she failed to respond to Nixon's proposal for a mutual withdrawal. Nixon and Kissinger subsequently discussed the exchanges with Gandhi. Kissinger's assessment was that "They are plotting a war." He felt that Nixon had given her a warm enough reception that she could not complain that the United States was anti-Indian. Nixon agreed.

  Open warfare erupted in East Pakistan on November 22 when India launched an offensive with two divisions supported by armor. The WSAG, which had been meeting with increasing frequency to assess the crisis, began almost daily meetings to map advice for the President. Indian forces pushed quickly into East Pakistan while Mukti Bahini guerrilla forces acted in support. Nixon's response was to cut off economic assistance to India, but, as Rogers told him, the leverage the United States could bring to bear with such a move was not liable to be effective. Still, Nixon instructed: "In terms of the merits of the situation, to the extent that we can tilt it toward Pakistan, I would prefer to play that." Pakistan sought to offset the pressure on its forces in East Pakistan by launching an attack on December 3 from West Pakistan. Pakistan's air force struck at six Indian airfields in Kashmir and the Punjab and Pakistani artillery began shelling at several points along the border. Kissinger told Nixon that the fighting in the west had been initiated by India. Nixon ordered a hold placed on $90 million in pending letters of credit for India.

  On December 4, United Nations Ambassador George Bush introduced a resolution in the Security Council which called for a cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of armed forces by India and Pakistan from each other's territories, and encouraged both countries to avail themselves of the Secretary General's offer to mediate. The resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union. On December 7, the United States sponsored a similar resolution in the General Assembly, where the Soviet Union could not exercise a veto, and it was adopted by a wide margin. The United States recognized, however, that the United Nations could do little to control the fighting on the subcontinent. Accordingly, Nixon and Kissinger increased the pressure on the Soviet Union to rein in India. On December 5, Kissinger called in Soviet Chargé Yuli Vorontsov and told him that Nixon could not understand how the United States and the Soviet Union could work toward détente on a variety of issues while Moscow was encouraging Indian aggression against Pakistan. Kissinger said that Nixon invited Brezhnev to join in the effort to put an end to the fighting on the subcontinent and return to working on a broad improvement in relations. Kissinger warned that the United States viewed the situation in South Asia as a "watershed" in U.S.-Soviet relations.Nixon underlined the points made by Kissinger to Vorontsov in a letter to Brezhnev on December 6. He warned that if India achieved its ends militarily, with Soviet support, it would have an adverse effect on U.S.-Soviet relations.Nixon and Kissinger agreed, when they discussed the crisis on December 6, that it was necessary to take a hard line with the Soviet Union. Kissinger said that it was the kind of signal the Soviets understood. "You'll be better off six months from now," he added. "If they lose respect for us now they'll put it to us."

  New evidence suggested to Nixon and Kissinger that rather than being restrained by Moscow, India was contemplating expanded military operations against West Pakistan. An intelligence report of a briefing that Gandhi gave in early December indicated that India enjoyed strong support from the Soviet Union, which had promised to counter-balance any move China might make against India in support of Pakistan. With that much support, Gandhi outlined her war aims: she would not accept a settlement until Bangladesh was liberated, the "southern area of Azad Kashmir" was liberated, and the Pakistani armored and air force strength was destroyed to prevent any future challenge to India. Nixon and Kissinger took this as proof that India planned not only to foster the independence of East Pakistan, but to use the opportunity of the crisis to inflict a crushing military defeat on Pakistan, which would lead to the breakup of West Pakistan. Kissinger attributed to the Gandhi government the goal of Balkanizing West Pakistan. If the crisis resulted in the dismemberment of Pakistan, Kissinger worried that China might conclude that the United States was "just too weak" to prevent the humiliation of an ally. He felt that the Chinese would then look to other options "to break their encirclement." He concluded that the situation represented "a big watershed." To increase pressure on the Soviet Union to restrain India, Kissinger advised that it might be necessary to call the projected summit meeting with the Soviet Union into question. Nixon agreed: "Maybe we have to put it to the Russians and say we have to cancel the summit." Kissinger advised Nixon to "play it out toughly" and anticipated that if a summit meeting did in the end prove possible, it would be one that Nixon could attend with his head up.

  On December 9, Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms warned the WSAG that Pakistani forces in East Pakistan were crumbling. When Nixon and Kissinger met in the Oval Office on December 9 to discuss the crisis, they had in mind the deteriorating situation in East Pakistan and the intelligence report on Prime Minister Gandhi's early December briefing, which they took to mean that after achieving victory in the east, India would shift its forces to the west and dismember Pakistan. At that point, Nixon decided to introduce the carrier Enterprise and its supporting vessels into the Bay of Bengal to apply military pressure on India. The rather transparent cover story was that the Enterprise was moving from Southeast Asia to the Bay of Bengal to help protect and withdraw U.S. citizens from East Pakistan. Nixon decided to pose an implied military threat to India. Later in the afternoon of December 9, Nixon applied further pressure on the Soviet Union. The Soviet Minister of Agriculture, Vladimir Matskevich, was in Washington and Nixon received him for what Matskevich assumed was a courtesy call. Instead, to his surprise, Nixon delivered a stern warning that the crisis on the subcontinent was poisoning the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. He asked "are short-term gains for India worth jeopardizing Soviet relations with the U.S.?" (257) On Nixon's instructions, Kissinger saw Vorontsov on December 10 and warned him that the United States had "treaty" obligations to Pakistan, established in 1959 and confirmed by President Kennedy, that required the United States to come to Pakistan's assistance in the event of aggression. The United States, he warned, intended to honor those commitments.

  The other element that Nixon wanted to see come into play in a belated effort to prevent India from crushing Pakistan was a threat from China. In a conversation with Kissinger in the Oval Office on December 10, Nixon instructed Kissinger to ask the Chinese to move some forces toward the frontier with India. "Threaten to move forces or move them, Henry, that's what they must do now." With those instructions, Kissinger went to New York the evening of December 10 and met with Huang Hua, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. He briefed Huang Hua on Gandhi's position and on the threat to West Pakistan as perceived in Washington. He told Huang Hua about the carrier force moving toward the Bay of Bengal. And, using diplomatic language, he relayed Nixon's request for Chinese military moves in support of Pakistan. Kissinger added that Nixon wanted China to know that if China took such action, the United States would oppose the efforts of others to interfere with China. There were no qualifications to Kissinger's diplomatically worded but clear assurance that the United States would be prepared for a military confrontation with the Soviet Union if the Soviet Union attacked China.

  On December 12, Nixon had to contemplate the implications of the assurance offered to the Chinese two days earlier. During the course of a conversation between Nixon and Kissinger in the Oval Office about the need for a military move by China to reinforce the impact of the arrival of the U.S. carrier off East Pakistan, Kissinger's deputy Alexander Haig entered with word that the Chinese wanted to have a meeting in New York. That was startling news. Kissinger said the Chinese had never initiated contact in New York. Suddenly it seemed likely that the China was going to move militarily against India. That raised the likelihood that the Soviet Union would be given an excuse to strike China. Kissinger said: "If the Soviets move against them and we don't do anything, we will be finished." Nixon asked: "So what do we do if the Soviets move against them? Start lobbing nuclear weapons in, is that what you mean?" Kissinger responded: "If the Soviets move against them in these conditions and succeed, that will be the final showdown...and if they succeed we will be finished." He added that "if the Russians get away with facing down the Chinese and the Indians get away with licking the Pakistanis...we may be looking down the gun barrel." In the end, they concluded that the projected confrontation with the Soviet Union would not involve a nuclear exchange. Kissinger felt that to preserve credibility, the United States, if necessary, would have to support China with conventional forces: "We have to put forces in. We may have to give them bombing assistance." Kissinger saw the danger of war between the Soviet Union and China as a strong possibility, with the Soviets looking for "a pretext to wipe out China," but Nixon concluded at the end of the discussion that "Russia and China aren't going to go to war."

  Nixon's prediction was borne out when it developed that China had no intention of threatening military action against India. Pakistani forces surrendered in East Pakistan on December 16 and India announced a cease-fire. With a nudge from Ambassador Farland, President Yahya accepted the cease-fire."<sup>[[6]](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/nixon/xi/45650.htm)</sup></sup>

However, a detailed study by Historian Ahern finds that the CIA, from 1965-1969 was split on the evidence intelligence suggested of such covert support by Sihanouk. Indeed, CIA scrapped all prior intel in 1969 to study from scratch, "OER undertook a comprehensive review, not only of the evidence but also of its own analytical methodology. Proceeding from primary reporting, the new effort would ignore all published analyses. Its objectivity would be assured by having it conducted by an officer without previous exposure to Cambodian analysis." However, ONE still leaned that the evidence wasn't enough, and downplayed key intelligence concerning the overland route. By 1970, however, the question was settled: Sihanouk had abandoned neutrality. Indeed, internal biases of sympathy existed in the CIA towards Prince Sihanouk, even as early as 1964: "Several participants in the debate later came to see individual and institutional bias as encouraging resistance to serious consideration of Sihanoukville as a major transit point for arms. [redacted] believed that service in Cambodia tended to generate sympathy for Sihanouk's position, as the Prince struggled to save his country with a neutralist balancing act. [redacted] remembered his own stance as open to Sihanouk's complicity in the arms traffic, but he agreed that pro-Sihanouk feeling was common [redacted]. But the phenomenon existed also at CIA. [redacted] remembered having absorbed the sentiment in OCI in the mid-1960s. He also recalled a visit to DDI Ray Cline's office, sometime in 1964, where Cline advised him to "take it easy on the Cambodians." [redacted] interpreted this cryptic guidance as suggesting he "cut Sihanouk some slack" when interpreting allegations of collusion with the VC/NVA that were already circulating." Official North Vietnamese histories published in 1994 and 1995 confirmed the use of Cambodia in trafficking: Chief editor, Nguyen Duy Tuong History of the Annamite Mountain Troops of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, "that the Lao Dong Party's Central Office for South Vietnam set up Rear Services Group 17 in July 1966 "in the friendly nation of Cambodia." Under the name "Hak Ly Company," it "established purchasing offices in a number of different areas in Cambodia." and Col. Gen. Tran Van Quang, Review of the Resistance War Against the Americans, "between 1966 and 1969, we shipped 21,400 tones of supplies through the port of Sihanoukville and paid the government more than 50 millionUS dollars in port fees and transportation charges."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/4_GOOD_QUESTIONS_WRONG_ANSWERS.pdf)</sup></sup>

The purpose of the program was to impede the North regime's supply of weapons and men to aid insurgent groups in the South, and in the long-term make continued physical support to insurgents too costly for North Vietnam.

- The US did not instigate or participate in the 1958 Indonesian rebellion, contrary to historical revisionists. In early 1957, the US  provided financial assistance to a group of dissident Indonesian Army Officers on the island of Sumatra, to maintain them as a force in being. This is known as Project HAIK. By 25 September 1957, the National Security Council had become concerned with the course of events in Indonesia and on its recommendation President Eisenhower authorized the Agency to employ "all feasible covert means" to support the dissidents. Planning for increased aid of all types began immediately, and in January 1958, a US arms shipment for the dissidents arrived in Sumatra. Then on 10 February, the situation came to a head. While Sukarno was out of the country on a state visit to Japan, the dissident Army colonels, without consulting CIA, organized  a Revolutionary Council in Padang, West Sumatra, and demanded the abolition of President Sukarno's "guided democracy" (a euphemism for a brutal dictatorship). Five days later, this council proclaimed itself the new "Revolutionary  Government" of Indonesia. President Sukarno's armed forces responded swiftly to this threat. In late February the Indonesian Air Force begun bombing dissident strongholds, and by mid-March government forces were conducting an all-out air-sea-land drive against the rebel-held areas in central Sumatra. Only after this blood-thirsty, and indiscriminate bombing campaign overreaction by the regime, did US volunteers aide the dissidents in a handful of bombing missions.<sup>[[1]](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2014-004-doc01.pdf#page=220)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP89B00552R000100040006-9.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/Groundwork%20for%20Initial%20Op%5B16060475%5D.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Many pundits and historical revisionists allege the US was behind the 1965 coup in Indonesia. The 30 September Movement. in reality: It was communists, aligned with some elements of the Army behind the coup. Declassified files from the Foreign Relations of the United States reveals many details, much to the dismay of historical revisionists and propagandists. A report from Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker to President Johnson, who, during his tour, found that the the situation deteriorated between the two nations, mostly concerning their aggression towards Malaysia.<sup>[[1]](https://ia800405.us.archive.org/18/items/indonesia-malaysia-singapore-philippines/Indonesia_Malaysia_Singapore_Philippines.pdf#page=293)</sup></sup> As noted in a memo from National Security Council Staff to the President's Special Assistant for National Security Affairs, the US was happy "Agree to disagree as friends.<sup>[[2]](https://ia800405.us.archive.org/18/items/indonesia-malaysia-singapore-philippines/Indonesia_Malaysia_Singapore_Philippines.pdf#page=287)</sup></sup> The US also continued on its Harbor Construction Project, a development loan granted well before Indonesia began its military confrontation against Malaysia.<sup>[[3]](https://ia800405.us.archive.org/18/items/indonesia-malaysia-singapore-philippines/Indonesia_Malaysia_Singapore_Philippines.pdf#page=297)</sup></sup> A note reads that a "4-page unattributed paper, March 10, recommended 'a carrot and stick proposition' to Sukarno since U.S.-Indonesian relations were at a crossroads and Sukarno must choose which fork to travel. The memorandum recommended as carrots a Presidential letter to Sukarno written "more in sorrow than in anger," a visit by Harriman or Robert Kennedy to offer U.S. good services to mediate the dispute with Malaysia, and the prospect of additional U.S. economic assistance. The United States would pass the word to moderate politicians and military leaders that the U.S. offer was their last chance. Should Indonesians reject the offer, the United States would increase the pressure by giving military assistance to the British and Malaysians including U.S. advisers. Should Indonesia persist in aggression against Malaysia, the United States should use air and naval power against Indonesian supply lines."<sup>[[4]](https://ia800405.us.archive.org/18/items/indonesia-malaysia-singapore-philippines/Indonesia_Malaysia_Singapore_Philippines.pdf#page=288)</sup></sup>

  A 1964 report notes, "There has, of course, been no authorization for direct attacks on Sukarno. The level of permissible risk-taking has naturally been very low and confined almost entirely to the realm of intelligence collection."<sup>[[5]](https://ia800405.us.archive.org/18/items/indonesia-malaysia-singapore-philippines/Indonesia_Malaysia_Singapore_Philippines.pdf#page=201)</sup></sup> A declassified memo prepared for the 303 Committee on February 23, 1965 does note that "Since the summer of 1964,[redacted] has worked with the Department of State in formulating concepts and developing an operational program of political action in Indonesia aimed at bolstering the more moderate elements in the Indonesian political spectrum. The aim of this political action program is to reduce the influence on Indonesian foreign and domestic policies of the PKI and the Government of Red China and to encourage and support existing non-Communist elements within Indonesia. The main thrust of this program is designed to exploit factionalism within the PKI itself, to emphasize traditional Indonesian distrust of Mainland China and to portray the PKI as an instrument of Red Chinese imperialism. Specific types of activity envisaged include covert liaison with and support to existing anti-Communist groups, particularly among the black letter operations, media operations, including possibly black radio, and political action within existing Indonesian organizations and institutions."<sup>[[6]](https://ia800405.us.archive.org/18/items/indonesia-malaysia-singapore-philippines/Indonesia_Malaysia_Singapore_Philippines.pdf#page=272)</sup></sup> However, this program proposal never materialised. 

  As one study notes, "the origins and outcome of the Sept 30 affair were the result of Indonesian actions alone. By the time the great powers realized what was underway, it was too late to help or hinder either side. Washington could only watch and wait, and hope that when the situation jelled, a new more constructive relationship could be established with whatever regime survived."<sup>[[7]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201017175932/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol14no2/pdf/v14i2a02p.pdf#page=16)</sup></sup> Indeed, all declassified files confirm: No outside involvement. In the earth-shattering, declassified 1968 treatise, The Coup that backfired, "In summary, although the Chinese may have been aware of the coup plans and certainly very much in sympathy with them, there is no evidence that the Chinese masterminded the Indonesian coup. On the contrary, the evidence is that the planning of the coup was done by Aidit and Sjam. It would seem unlikely, in fact, that the Chinese were informed of specific details of the coup planning, such as the timing of the coup. There probably was not the time or the opportunity to inform the Chinese of the date set for the coup without risk to the secrecy of the plans. The final decision on the timing seems to have been made by Aidit on the evening of the 28th and communicated to the military leaders of the coup the next day, only a little more than 24 hours before the start of the coup. It is questionable that Aidit would have told the Chinese the exact timing of the' coup, anyway, for security and other reasons. There is some indication that the Chinese were actually caught by surprise on the day of the coup. Mao made some remarks to a group of visiting Indonesian officials on 30 September that it seems he would not have made if he had known that the coup would be staged that very might, since, under the circumstances, his remarks could be taken to imply Chinese foreknowledge of the coup. On the matter of the Chinese involvement, the evidence is simply not conclusive, much less so than it is on other aspects of the coup. This ambigity is unlikely to change unless and until information is obtained on Aidit's conversations with the Chinese in Peking in early August 1965 or on Dani's secret negotiations with the Chinese in September.<sup>[[8]](https://web.archive.org/web/20171208040813/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/esau-40.pdf#page=330)</sup></sup> Regarding interrogation reports, the study comments, "In conclusion, although there are certain difficulties in piecing together the whole story of the conspiracy that lay behind the events of 1 October—considering the fact that the coup preparations were a well kept secret all during the time they were in progress and there is no independent reporting to confirm or deny what is really the only important source of our information on the subject. Redacted the word of the conspirators themselves—there is good reason to think that we do now know the essential truth about those preparations. Although it is not and never will be a matter of proven fact—in the way that the events of 1 October and the days following can be established as fact—the true story of the conspiracy behind the coup seems to us to have been established beyond any reasonable doubt in the confessions of those involved in the conspiracy."<sup>[[9]](https://web.archive.org/web/20171208040813/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/esau-40.pdf#page=355)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123064222/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T03194A000300010008-4.pdf#page=97)</sup></sup>

  The US thus also had no involvement in the assassination, as confirmed by the declassified Rockefeller commission.<sup>[[11]](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf#page=9)</sup></sup> Conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists also claim that the State Department and CIA were complicit in the Indonesian purge. This is based on a distortion and misrepresentation by Kathy Kadane, in her work, to reference of individuals she relies on as sources. As a result, they wrote letters to the editor, calling her out. Scholars have also disputed this charge. As one leading expert found, “The United States did not overthrow Sukarno, and it was not responsible for the hundreds of thousands of deaths involved in the liquidation of the PKI.” Further, it is doubtful that the small list of names provided by Martens aided in any purges.<sup>[[12]](https://academic.oup.com/jah/article-abstract/76/3/785/760066?login=false)</sup></sup> As he points out, "the names I gave were based entirely—I repeat entirely—on the Indonesia Communist press and were available to everyone. This was a senior cadre system of the PKI—a few thousand at most out of the 3.5 million claimed party members.” Martens stressed that these lists of PKI members were “not party rank and file.” Martens also stated categorically in his letter that, “I and I alone decided to pass those ‘lists’ to the non-Communist forces. I neither sought nor was given permission to do so by Ambassador Marshall Green or any other embassy official.” Martens concluded with the statement that he did not turn over classified information nor was he the head of an Embassy group that spent 2 years compiling the lists as stated in the article in The Washington Post. He stated that there was no such group."<sup>[[13]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225185451/https://www.aim.org/publications/aim_report/1990/09b.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[14]](https://ia800405.us.archive.org/18/items/indonesia-malaysia-singapore-philippines/Indonesia_Malaysia_Singapore_Philippines.pdf#page=424)</sup></sup> Yes, the CIA did produced estimates of the death toll, long after the fact. That cannot be read of their involvement. By this logic, all news orgs across the globe were involved.

  The Embassy in Djakarta was hampered in its reporting on events in the areas outside the capital by the general confusion and chaos of the initial conflict between the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI) on one hand and the Indonesian Army and anti-Communist forces on the other. At first the Embassy viewed the fighting & violence as a potential military/guerrilla conflict & concentrated on the PKI's armed activity & its potential for terrorism. In a telegram from Djakarta, October 27, 1965, the Embassy recounted multiple reports of increasing insecurity and mounting bloodshed in Central Java, but could not determine whether it was caused by the PKI moving towards terrorism & sabotage, "local PKI cadres reacting uncoordinatedly to pressures upon them," or the Army "purposely moving to wipe out questionable elements and gain control." On October 28 the Embassy reported that a PKI source alleged that the PKI was about to engage in a "war of liberation" and cited incidents of PKI terrorism to support this conclusion. The telegram stated, "There is no question, even allowing for exaggeration, that PKI acts of terrorism have increased." On October 28 the Embassy Country Team reviewed the situation and sent its appraisal. Although the report emphasized the deteriorating security situation in Central Java, East Java, Bandung, and Djakarta, the team could not say "whether these incidents were isolated acts of local communists or beginning of a coordinated act of terror and sabotage." The report concluded that Indonesia was heading for a "period of chaos, since PKI has residual strength and arms, but balance seems on Army side." At the end of October 1965, the Embassy began to receive reports of killings and atrocities against PKI members, which were generally reported upon in the context of continued armed PKI resistance."<sup>[[15]](https://ia800405.us.archive.org/18/items/indonesia-malaysia-singapore-philippines/Indonesia_Malaysia_Singapore_Philippines.pdf#page=376)</sup></sup> Another study found that only around 105,000 people were killed. Not the unsupported 350,000 or 1.5 million figure. Further, a critical examination and fact-check of many of the supposed massacres, indeed, never took place. Yes: Some did—but not in the scope and scale.<sup>[[16]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201017175932/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol14no2/pdf/v14i2a02p.pdf#page=11)</sup></sup> Note that The New Yorker put the death toll at "more than a million," while In These Times used 500,000. Kathy Kadane's story said, "In a 1968 report, the CIA estimated there had been 250,000 deaths and called the carnage 'one of the worst mass murders of the 20th Century.'" What the CIA report actually said is that the estimate of deaths ranged from "87,000, the official Indonesian government estimate, to 500,000." It added: "The U.S. Embassy estimated the figure to be closer to 250,000. It would be a mistake to put too much faith in any of the various estimates. It was impossible even at the time, to get accurate figures of the number of people killed in one neighborhood.... Thus, there never was—and never will be m a reliable figure of the numbers dead as a result of the Indonesian coup." (Indonesia 1965: The Coup that Backfired) For Kadane to attribute the 250,000 figure to the CIA and to ignore the caution that all the estimates were unreliable was not simply careless. It was dishonest because she had been told how the embassy in Jakarta had arrived at an estimate of the number killed in response to the State Department's insistence that it come up with a number.<sup>[[17]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225185451/https://www.aim.org/publications/aim_report/1990/09b.html)</sup></sup>

- The Vietnam war and the US' entire air campaign; counter to many historical revisionists, was actually hampered by strict Rules of Engagement that often left the Military allowing the Vietcong to remain safe, even though they're far clear of any surrounding civilian populations. In another scholarly paper by a world-leading legal expert and practitioner, it was found while studying Air Force ROEs, "the policy of gradualism, implemented by the Rolling Thunder bombing campaign over North Vietnam between 1965 and 1968, resulted in ROE of unprecedented detail and restrictiveness."<sup>[[1]](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Rules-of-Engagement-for-Land-Forces%3A-A-Matter-of-Martins/7e772b364572c7a5efe69de72538444c85cf099e)</sup></sup> Indeed, an internal air force study prior concluded the same, "military barracks were prohibited. The suppression of SAMS and gun-laying radar systems was prohibited in this area as were attacks on NVN air bases from which attacking aircraft might be operating."<sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA597620/page/n1/mode/2up)</sup></sup>

- Between 1942 and 1960, it has been charged that the United States influenced the Philippines via its "capitalistic elite," on US foreign policy. This hypothesis has been dispelled by a close and critical examination of US and Philippine government archives by world-leading historian, Nick Cullather in his monograph, 'Illusions of Influence The Political Economy of United States-Philippines Relations, 1942-1960.' "Based on extensive research in U.S. and Philippine archives, Cullather's study exposes the limits of American influence with its former colony. Its thesis, simply stated, is that a succession of Philippine presidents consistently thwarted U.S. policy initiatives, particularly ones aimed at reforming the Philippine economy, because their agendas differed from those of U.S. administrations. Whereas American policy makers wanted to promote economic growth and to eliminate corruption in order to insure the stability of the new, strategically important nation-state, Philippine leaders aimed, above all, to reward domestic political allies with economic advantages and to promote the Philippine manufacturing sector, however inefficient, at the expense of Chinese and foreign competitors. Cullather explodes a number of myths in this book. He shows, for example, that the close economic ties established between the United States and the Philippines after 1946-including a preferential tariff system were not imposed on an unwilling Philippine government. In fact, Philippine leaders favored those ties, believing that the country's economic health depended on them. Furthermore, they were approved over the strong objections of the U.S. State Department, which opposed special bilateral arrangements. Cullather recounts, too, the largely successful efforts of the administrations of Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino to resist U.S. efforts to dictate policy. Perhaps his most arresting findings relate to Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay, typically depicted as a creature of C.I.A. operative Edward Lansdale. But, as Cullather demonstrates, Magsaysay adeptly used his close U.S. connections to enlarge his patronage base and gave little attention to land and tax reform programs favored by the U.S. government because they threatened to undermine Magsaysay's alliances with planters, industrialists, and warlords. Even on regional security matters, Magsaysay was anything but a puppet, effectively resisting U.S. pressure to recognize South Vietnam and to grant additional land for military bases. Rather than being manipulated by Lansdale, Magsaysay was a master manipulator."<sup>[[1]](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/101/1/262/18599)</sup></sup> " This well-written and instructive book succeeds admirably in its objectives. First, it convincingly challenges conventional wisdom that Washington easily dominated postwar United States-Philippines relations. Second, it demonstrates that world systems analysis and dependency theory need to take into account more fully the nuances of a client-patron relationship. Third, it shows that when historians of diplomacy venture overseas to research foreign archives and to learn about foreign cultures, they may discover that American influence—so often portrayed as fact in United States documents—is in many ways illusory.<sup>[[2]](https://academic.oup.com/jah/article-abstract/82/3/1275/676232?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false)</sup></sup>
  
- In 1951, the Dalai Lama pleaded with the international community publicly, and to the US secretly, to aid the Tibetan people against the illegal, genocidal imperialistic campaign of the Chinese communists in Tibet. Chinese psyops have attempted to tarnish the image of the Tibetans as religious bourgeoisie. Most Tibetans, however, are neither monks nor nobles but peasants, often tenants, or nomadic herders. As one of the leading historians on the CIA's aid to the Tibetan people notes, “In 1950 the Chinese came to Kham.” This was the opening sentence of what became a familiar litany to American officers who worked with the Tibetans on one of the more total and romantic programs of covert action undertaken by the Agency. With this simple description, the pragmatic Tibetans would proceed to make their case for American support in a common fight. The Tibetans told a story of how the Chinese were systematically setting out to destroytheir culture, particularly the religion around which their lives were organized. Like frontiersmen, they asked for help, not in terms of money or subsidies, but for arms and training so that they might fight their own fight. The Tibetans’ pleas fell on responsive ears within the U.S. Government. North Korea had invaded South Korea in June of that year and the U.S. Government was still smarting over the Chinese Communist takeover of the mainland the year before. When the Dalai Lama sent emissaries from Yatung, his temporary capital just across the Tibet-Sikkim border, they found willing negotiators within the American Embassy in India. The 15-year-old Dalai Lama had decided to come to Yatung after his plea to the United Nations in December 1950 had produced no helpful response. His advisors had been concerned that if he stayed in Lhasa he might be captured and the central figure of their civilization thereby be lost. The young ruler was faced with the decision of whether to return to Lhasa and attempt to alleviate the lot of his people by working with the Chinese, or to flee abroad where he and his ecclesiastical court might act as a rallying point for the resistance effort then being organized in eastern Tibet.

  The Dalai Lama made his way back up the Chumbi Valley in July 1952, and the U.S. promises of covert aid were shelved while the god-king attempted to reach an accommodation with the Chinese. Under the agreement which Tibetan representatives had signed under duress in the Dalai Lama’s absence in 1951, the Chinese extended their occupation throughout all of Tibet. Life under their rule became increasingly harsh. Various efforts which the Dalai Lama made both to mitigate this rule and to reform his own archaic government were frustrated by the Chinese. By 1956 the Dalai Lama had despaired of his ability to provide effective political rule to his country, and he considered withdrawal from all secular life. UN resolution of 21 October 1959 which deplored Chinese Communist violations of human rights in Tibet. 

  In the summer of 1961 the Dalai Lama announced plans for a new constitution. Tge Agency had encouraged this move by the Dalai Lama, and Ambassador Gross had drafted a preliminary document. The Dalai Lama modified this document to fit his idiom and ideas which were surprisingly liberal, particularly concerning his willingness to give up state lands and subject himself to a form of recall. His scattered constituents debated and voted on this constitution in refugee camps throughout India and Nepal for the following two years. The only popularly expressed reservations were that the Dalai Lama had granted too generous a constitution. The international community had been informed of this constituent process by an article by Ambassador Gross which appeared in the October edition of Foreign Affairs, By the time the UN again considered Tibet at its autumn 1961 session, the Tibetans had additional evidence to back their claim to political self- determination. On 20 December the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution renewing its call for the cessation of practices which deprived the Tibetan people of their fundamental human rights and freedom, including their right to self-determination. This was to be the height of UN support for Tibetan aspirations. Finally, our involvement was right for the times and the ideal we professed. The Tibetans never approached us as supplicants, but as fellow believers in similar democratic values who were temporary victims of a common enemy. They asked for the means to fight for their own cause, which they assumed was ours. Our willingness to respond to this appeal was noted by those other nations who were then judging our readiness to commit ourselves against our professions. It was an honorable operation."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/COVERT%20ACTION%20IN%20HIGH%20ALT%5B14688685%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20141013004630/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/DOC_0005543224.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- In 1950, it was alleged that A US airstrike deliberately targeted South Korean refugees in the village of Nogeun-ri (No Gun Ri).
An independent and authoritative investigation summarised as follows: "Over the last year, the Review Team has conducted an exhaustive factual review by examining over a million documents from the National Archives, conducting interviews with approximately 200 American witnesses, and analyzing the interview transcripts and oral statements of approximately 75 Korean witnesses.  The U.S. Review Team also closely examined press reports, aerial imagery, and other forensic examination results.  This U.S. Report reflects the U.S. Review Team’s factual findings based upon all the evidence available on the incident. During late July 1950, Korean civilians were caught between withdrawing U.S. forces and attacking enemy forces.  As a result of U.S. actions during the Korean War in the last week of July 1950, Korean civilians were killed and injured in the vicinity of No Gun Ri.  The Review Team did not find that the Korean deaths and injuries occurred exactly as described in the Korean account.  To appraise these events, it is necessary to recall the circumstances of the period.  U.S. forces on occupation duty in Japan, mostly without training for, or experience in, combat were suddenly ordered to join ROK forces in defending against a determined assault by well-armed and well-trained NKPA forces employing both conventional and guerilla warfare tactics.  The U.S. troops had to give up position after position.  In the week beginning July 25, 1950, the 1st Cavalry Division, withdrawing from Yongdong toward the Naktong River, passed through the vicinity of No Gun Ri.  Earlier, roads and trails in South Korea had been choked with civilians fleeing south.  Disguised NKPA soldiers had mingled with these refugees.  U.S. and ROK commanders had published a policy designed to limit the threat from NKPA infiltrators, to protect U.S. forces from attacks from the rear, and to prevent civilians from interfering with the flow of supplies and troops.  The ROK National Police were supposed to control and strictly limit the movements of innocent refugees. In these circumstances, especially given the fact that many of the U.S. soldiers lacked combat-experienced officers and Non-commissioned officers, some soldiers may have fired out of fear in response to a perceived enemy threat without considering the possibility that they might be firing on Korean civilians."<sup>[[1]](https://ia903406.us.archive.org/33/items/nogunrireview/nogunrireview.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1950s, The Soviet Union, China and North Korea started propaganda that the US had used Biological weapons against civilians and combatants. This has been a long-debunked conspiracy theory.<sup>[[1]](https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/leitenberg_biological_weapons_korea.pdf)</sup></sup> Tactics used by China and NK include the establishment of fake Scientific panels, presenting fabricated evidence.<sup>[[2]](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/250/korean-war-biological-warfare-allegations)</sup></sup> Other papers from 1995<sup>[[3]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7783939/)</sup></sup> and even recent declassified documents<sup>[[4]](https://web.archive.org/web/20200425205433/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01731R003300190004-6.pdf)</sup></sup> discussing analysis of the ISC report have flaws in logic, biology and methodology<sup>[[5]](https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/leitenberg_biological_weapons_korea.pdf)</sup></sup> as well as intelligence reporting about the deliberate lies from the USSR on the matter.<sup>[[6]](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20419558/bw-comint-baptism-files.pdf)</sup></sup> This type of propaganda wasn't unique to USSR/NK/China allegations to the US.

Since then, nothing like it has returned. However the list incorrectly states it was between 347-504 civilians killed. It was 175.

- In 1967, the South Vietnamese government operated a program called Phung Hoang or Phoenix. CIA aided in it, but it was not theirs.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77M00144R000300130040-4.pdf)</sup> It has been alleged that it was an assassination/torture program—this is not true.<sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R000800090012-8.pdf#page=5)</sup> Since independent actions against the CVI were deemed inefficient and ineffective, the Phung Hoang program was conceived to unite and coordinate a total government effort against the VCI. As such, Phung Hoand represented an intelligence coordination mechanism—in the form of coordinating committees at the province, regional and national level; and intelligence and operations coordinating centers at the province and district level—which aimed at a united total governmental effort against the CVI. It was _not_ a program of assassination or terror in response to Communist terror, and the program did not authorise torture, brutality or cruel methods in the interrogation or handling of captives. The US further worked with the Government to make sure adequate, humane treatment as focal, observing fair concepts of due process and improve conditions of internment.<sup>[[3]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001100060018-1.pdf)</sup> <sup>[[4]](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/3-CIA_AND_RURAL_PACIFICATION.pdf#page=287)</sup>

- 1955-1973. There were two phases of the US involvement in Laos. One was waged in the north to assure the independence, territorial integrity, and neutrality of the Laotian government, guaranteed by the 1954 and 1962 Geneva agreements. The other was waged in the south to arrest the infiltration of manpower and supplies from communist North Vietnam to the Viet Cong insurgents in non-communist South Vietnam, to which US forces were committed to minimizing civilian casualties via strict ROEs.

  The Geneva agreements of 1954, ending French control over Indochina, left the Kingdom of Laos a very fragile country, ruled by contesting factions. There were separate military groupings with the neutralists controlling the Royal Laotian Army (shortly renamed the Forces Armees du Royaume or FAR) and a Pathet Lao army occupying two northern provinces, Houa Phan, also called Samneua, and Phong Saly. The population of three million included a small, French-educated elite and numerous diverse, illiterate tribal groups who lived in isolated jungle and mountainous areas. The United States supported but did not sign the 1954 Geneva agreements. It nevertheless believed that the free world’s interest required keeping Laos and two other newly created Indochina states, South Vietnam and Cambodia, outside the orbit of Communist North Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union. The provisions applicable to Laos forbade the Vientiane government from entering into any foreign military alliance, called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops except a French military training mission, and limited the types and amount of military equipment that could be used by the small Royal Laotian Army of 10,000 men. Also established was an International Control Commission consisting of Indian, Canadian, and Polish representatives to ensure compliance with the provisions. Given Laos’s weaknesses, the impreciseness of some of the agreement’s provisions, and the suspicions in Washington of the intentions of Hanoi, Peking, and Moscow, enforcement of the agreements to assure Laos’s neutrality promised to be difficult. With few exceptions, the Pathet Lao barred the International Control Commission from entering its occupied areas (including several occasions firing on ICC helicopters), and Hanoi made no significant withdrawal of its North Vietnamese cadres engaged in training, equipping, and supporting their Pathet Lao allies.
  
  The pseudo-nationalist Communist insurgent group, the Pathet Lao, under the control of North Vietnam (in direct violation of the Geneva Accords), started an insurrection via a campaign of propaganda<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-00915R000600080007-0.pdf)</sup></sup> and terrorism, to sway towards North Vietnam. Under SEATO, to which Laos was not party to, the United Stated provided non-military aid to the country to repel the Pathet Lao, in the form of the Program Evaluation Office (PEO), in compliance with the Geneva Agreement.<sup>[[2]](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/war_in_northern_laos.pdf)</sup></sup> In 1958, the CIA entered the scene: It begun two operations, one civic program to locally  encourage the government to focus on the welfare of rural populations and the working class and the other, focused on small, mobile units designed to operate in enemy-held territory, challenging Pathet Lao control and organizing civilian resistance.<sup>[[3]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/6_UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf)</sup></sup> In 1960 the US began reconnaissance flights to document Pathet Lao's violations.<sup>[[4]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001300050007-2.pdf)</sup></sup> These terminated in 1962 after a new Agreement was reached.
  
  Two crises drew the United States deeper into Laos’s internal affairs. The first occurred on April 10 when a rightist faction of the Government of National Union again attempted a coup to replace Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma. American officials acted quickly to restore things as they were. The second crisis derived from the first. Taking advantage of the political disarray in Vientiane, the Pathet Lao in mid-May stepped up military operations against neutralist Kong Le’s forces and shortly captured the Plain of Jars. In Washington, State and Defense officials now believed the upsurge in communist activity warranted an additional response. The Laos government had requested the recon missions to assist the International Control Commission in documenting Pathet Lao violations of the 1962 Geneva agreements. In Jun 1964, a US Navy reconnaissance aircraft was shot down, in response, President Johnson, with Prime Minister Souvanna’s approval, quickly ordered fighter escorts for the reconnaissance aircraft with pilots henceforth authorized to return enemy fire. Continued violations by Communist North Vietnam would further escalate the US response up until 1973 via bombing campaigns to target Viet Cong under strict ROE to limit civilian casualties<sup>[[5]](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/27/2001329814/-1/-1/0/AFD-100927-078.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Oct/06/2001329752/-1/-1/0/AFD-101006-027.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://archive.org/details/cambodia-laos-review)</sup></sup>

  In the early 1970s, allegations of CIA's complicity in illegal drug trafficking in Laos (and the broader Golden Triangle). One such popular perpetrator of this lie was grad student, Alfred W. McCoy. His allegations couldn't be further from the truth. As leading historian, Thomas Ahern finds in his earth-shattering study, "CIA Headquarters and Stations in Asia actively pressured the resistance groups they aided from engaging in such activities, such as driving the Yao chieftain Chao out of the business; the Agency also made sure no US assets would be used for illegal smuggling. CIA's sensitivities to the illegal activity was so great, that one "acting chief of security once proposed a sting operation, with narcotics on an Air America plane going to Saigon used to lure traffickers there into a trap. Devlin imagined the press hysteria that would result if word got out about drugs moving on the CIA's airline, and he rejected the idea on the spot." In a famous incident, an "Agency officer authorised an impromptu raid on a heroin nest. Soon after, a sharp rebuke in a cable came from the Office of General Counsel, as it represented a cross violation of property rights. When the Nixon White House learned of this incident—a cable came in, expressing President Nixon's admiration for the raid. This marked marked the emergence of the narcotics issue as a priority."<sup>[[8]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/6_UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf#page=541)</sup></sup> Only one exception was found, early 1968, "through the efforts of CIA Staff Agent Security Officers, over 400 pounds of opium was seized aboard an Air America aircraft destined to fly from Vientiane, Laos, to Saigon, South Vietnam. This matter was reported to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. Investigation resulted in appropriate criminal action taken. The opium was turned over to the CIA station in Vietiane and ultimately destroyed."  Air America strengthened its security process—as a consequence of this, Air America personnel busted two Royal Lao Air force personnel, smuggling 120 pounds in 1971.<sup>[[9]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP73B00296R000300060032-8.pdf)</sup></sup>

  McCoy's allegations were also investigated by the Church Committee, and Inspector General. Both soundly refute all charges. The Church report finds, after lengthy discussion, "the Committee has concluded that the CIA air proprietaries did not participate in illicit drug trafficking."<sup>[[10]](https://archive.org/details/cia-rdp-92-m-00732-r-000700070024-8)</sup></sup> The IG report concludes, "no evidence that the Agency, or any senior officer of the Agency, has ever sanctioned or supported drug trafficking. Also, we found not the slightest suspicion, much less evidence, that any Agency officer, staff or contractor, has been involved in the drug business. With respect to Air America, we found that it has always forbidden, as a matter of policy, the transportation aboard its aircraft. We believe that its Security Inspection Service, which is used by the cooperating air transport company as well, is now serving as an added deferent to drug traffickers." Mr McCoy's evidence has been carefully examined and it fails to substantiate his charges." It also notes, among many examples,  "clear that Agency personnel in the area recognized its dangers to US paramilitary operations and took steps to discouraged its use by indigenous paramilitary troops. For example, Meo troops were ejected from various camps when they were caught."<sup>[[11]](https://archive.org/details/cia-rdp-74-b-00415-r-000400020028-2)</sup></sup>

  Indeed, the US engaged in a massive campaign to counter narcotics in Southeast Asia, with varying degrees of success, with local governments.<sup>[[12]](https://archive.org/details/cia-rdp-74-b-00415-r-000100100002-4)</sup></sup> <sup>[[13]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85T00283R000200060006-4.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[14]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/PROSPECTS%20FOR%20REDUCING%20HE%5B15685918%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> Meanwhile, it was the Chinese who controlled basically the entire drug system in Asia.<sup>[[15]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/OVERSEAS%20CHINESE%20INVOLVEM%5B15649894%5D.pdf#page=2)</sup></sup>
  
- In the summer of 1950 in South Korea, South Korea engaged in a massacre. British and US Governments tried to prevent it, and managed to save a large number of civilians. United States official documents show that John J. Muccio, then United States Ambassador to South Korea, made recommendations to South Korean President Rhee Syngman and Defense Minister Shin Sung-mo that the executions be stopped. Great Britain raised this issue with the U.S. at a diplomatic level, causing Dean Rusk, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, to inform the British that U.S. commanders were doing "everything they can to curb such atrocities". During the massacre, the British protected their allies and saved some citizens.

- The US involvement in Vietnam is one of nuance and slow buildup. In 1955, the US reached a formal advisory role to South Vietnam. In 1959, two US Military advisors were killed in a terror attack at Bien Hoa. The advisory role and eventual military training assistance by 1961, were all brought about by the increased North Vietnam attacks of aggression. Indeed, the first POW of the war, George Fryett, was kidnapped for the crime of riding his bicycle on the outskirts of Saigon. By 1962, due to the ongoing attacks by the North communist regime—in direct violation of both international law, the SEATO Treaty and the Geneva Accords of 1954—South Vietnam asks the United States for assistance in self-defense, which leads to an increase in US assistance. The full conflict begins in 1964. So begins the military operations until 1975.<sup>[[1]](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/Military-Assistance-Advisory-Group-Indochina-is-Re-Designated-MAAG-Vietnam/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/Two-U-S-Military-Advisers-Are-Killed-At-Bien-Hoa/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/Civilian-Irregular-Defense-Groups-Formally-Established/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/First-U-S-POW-In-Vietnam/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://dsc.duq.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1330&context=dlr)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400885909-017/html?lang=en) </sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/794921?origin=crossref)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-legal-materials/article/abs/legal-memorandum-on-us-action-in-vietnam/756631751CE81CBF218B31528720DB82)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/lawfulness-of-military-assistance-to-the-republic-of-vietnam/CE962350F9CC548F3D5E64F179B2EAD6)</sup></sup>

  Many groundbreaking, authoritative monographs of US activities, attitudes and policy decisions towards Asia have been written, and provide the most detailed, in-depth examination of several decades:
  - US Intelligence and Vietnam provides a detailed examination of finished intelligence relating to the Vietnam conflict from the time of introduction of US combat forces in 1965 through the fall of the Saigon Government in 1975. In settling on the scope of the study, it was decided to go back to the beginning of the American involvement in Indochina toward the end of World War II and cover at least the major developments that occurred during a period of approximately three decades. 1945-1975.<sup>[[10]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123192047/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001433692.pdf)</sup></sup>
  - CIA and the House of Ngo notes how the CIA aided in establishing a civilian government in South Vietnam. As Diem became more authoritarian and suppressive of minorities, the US tried to persuade him to abide by human rights, however, upon this failing, encouraged but was not involved in, the coup by the military. Ahern traces CIA efforts to bring stability and democracy to South Vietnam and to influence Diem. Although not uncritical of US policy and CIA operations, Ahern's study reveals a CIA Station-indeed in the early years, two Stations-working diligently and effectively to aid Diem in forming a viable state.<sup>[[11]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/2_CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdf)</sup></sup>

  - CIA and Rural pacification details CIA's efforts to win the "hearts and minds" of the South Vietnamese rural population. It's a compelling account of CIA's contributions to the US effort to establish and preserve an independent nation in South Vietnam. Despite local success, the CIA effort was, in the end, part of a major tragedy. No one, either in Washington or in the field, grasped the immense complexity and difficulty in instituting a massive effort to control the contryside, win the support of the peasantry, and promote political reforms, while fighting a determined and entrenched enemy.<sup>[[13]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/3_CIA_AND_RURAL_PACIFICATION.pdf)</sup></sup>

  It has been alleged that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a US false flag to justify the Vietnam war, and that it's admitted in the declassified record. This is a well-debunked myth. The list cites a wiki entry, which cites to a declassified NSA document as evidence. However, problems arise when one actually reads the document in question. 1) It's an opinion piece in NSA's Cryptologic Quarterly. 2) The author in the study actually cautions against a conspiracy theory take, "This mishandling of SIGINT was not done in a manner that can be construde as conspiratorial , that is, with manufactured evidence and collusion at all levels. Rather, the objective of these individuals was to support the Navy's claim that the Desoto patrol had been deliberately attacked by the North Vietnamese." It's worth noting as well, that the NSA, while appreciative of the study, disagrees with the author's central premise: That SIGINT/COMINT was mishandled. According to the response, "This article does dispute Mr. Hanyok's assertion that SIGINT was mishandled, deliberately skewed or not provided to the Johnson administration. In fact, the record shows that NSA performed magnificently during this period of crisis, providing all SIGINT available in a timely manner to a broad spectrum of customers. With only a few trained Vietnamese linguists at NSA Headquarters and field stations analyzing encrypted North Vietnamese communications, NSA still provided U.S. forces advance warning of possible intended attacks that quite likely prevented the sinking of a U.S. destroyer on 2 August.

  Further evidence refuting the claim that COMINT information was presented in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events of 4 August 1964 can be found in the NSA review of Secretary McNamara's testimony before Congress. NSA noted that McNamara systematically used overkill language with COMINT and that the COMINT surrounding Tonkin was "flexible for interpretation". Again in 1972, as noted by Mr. Hanyok, NSA Deputy Director Dr. Tordella provided Senator Fulbright's staff director Carl Marcy access to all NSA material relating to the Gulf of Tonkin and told Mr. Marcy that the intercept of 4 August could indeed refer to events that occurred on 2 August. These facts make it clear that NSA consistently provided the Administration, as well as Congress, all COMINT information related to the events of 2-4 August. In fact, one NSA manager present during the August 1964 events has stated, "the folks downtown were provided all of the COM INT as they wanted to do their own analysis. They weren't overly interested in what we thought." Some would argue that NSA should have explicitly informed decision makers in formal SIGINT reporting that COMINT showed there was no attack on 4 August. However, the available COMINT could not support such a position. While some analysts did indeed come to such a conclusion, the COMINT itself, as noted by Dr. Tordella, was "flexible for interpretation". In the final analysis, it is clear that not only was SIGINT information _not_ presented in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events of 4 August 1964, but that all of the COM INT produced was distributed to CIA, JCS, DIA and other customers and that NSA uncertainties, even of single words, were made known to decision makers."<sup>[[14]](https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/gulf-of-tonkin/articles/release-2/rel2_thoughts_intelligence.pdf)</sup></sup>

  2. Army minimised its abuses. Improving on its adherence to the rule of law.
  3. The Communist party joining the rebellion, urging for more radical changes than what the peasants  espoused. The wide gap between the Communist leaders and the peasants was never bridged, thus weakening the movement.

  Indeed, the author credits well-documented US efforts to shape this reform, working with the Filipino Government. As noted in a critically-acclaimed history, 'The Hukbalahap Insurrection: A case study of a successful anti-insurgency Operation in the Philippines - 1946–1955', "Graft and corruption ran rampant in government. The Roxas administration seemed to condone it and did nothing to conceal its presence or depth. In a 1948 letter to General Omar Bradley, the Chief of Staff, Major General George F. Moore (Commander, U.S. Army Philippine-Ryukyus Command) reported that Philippine law enforcement and court systems were inadequate, applied arbitrarily, and did not protect the citizen. Rather. he reported they were being used as tools by government officials, wealthy landowners, and businessmen." Magsaysay became a key figure in cleaning house when he took the position of secretary: Removing corruption within the military and providing justice reform across the board. This only became more pronounced when he became President.

  "A prominent factor in the successful anti-guerrilla campaign was the close, personal relationship that developed between Edward Lansdale and Ramon Magsaysay. This relationship provided an effective conduit through which American advice affected Philippine actions during this period. To overlook Lansdale's role would be to neglect a significant chapter of this story. Lansdale was given exceptional freedom of action and quickly became Hegsaysey's de facto personal advisor. Often the two talked long into the night about conditions that fostered the insurrection and about the real need for governmental and social reforms. Shortly thereafter. Magsaysay took steps to revitalize the military, improve pay and morale, eliminate corrupt officers, and foster his campaign to win the people back to the central government. The people saw clear evidence of military professionalism, competence, and honesty (quite a dramatic change) and through the military's behavior. began to realize that Magsaysay was working for their benefit. To what did Edward Lansdale credit his success? First and foremost, he dealt with Magsaysay and the Filipinos as friends and equals. Filipinos viewed friendship as a deeper and longer-lived relationship than Americans did. To them, friendship involved total acceptance into their their most valued social institution—the family. Trusting the Filipinos, allowing them to form their own solutions to their problems with a minimum of interference, and always treating them as equals were Lansdale's keys to success. He advised them on counter-guerrilla tactics and helped them lessen their reliance on conventional operations, but he always made sure they were responsible for the decisions. He maintained a low-profile and allowed Filipinos to take credit for successful operations, concurrently building pride and confidence in the AFP and their fellow countrymen. As retired Maj. Gen. Lansdale so aptly put it. the Filipinos best knew the problems, best knew how to solve them, and did it—with U.S. aid and advice, but without U.S. domination of their effort."<sup>[[1]](https://history.army.mil/html/books/093/93-8/CMH_Pub_93-8-1.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2801097)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/combat-studies-institute/csi-books/ArtOfWar_AmericaAndThePhilippines.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Indeed, a December 1961 report by the Counter-Guerrilla warfare Task Force credits Magsaysay's efforts: "The post-war experience in the Philippines illustrates some political and organizational devices that can play a highly constructive role in winning the grass-roots popular support so necessary for frustrating a subversive guerrilla movement. Following the 1949 presidential election, which was widely regarded as dishonest, the Communist-influenced Huk guerrillas argued that the only way the government could really be changed was by popular force. By 1951, the Huks had a guerrilla strength of 15, 000 and a mass base of about a million supporters and sympathizers, mostly tenant farmers on Luzon.

  Under Magsaysay's leadership, the Philippine Army undertook to win back popular support from the guerrillas by holding a new and demonstrably free and honest election and by inaugurating new administrative and organizational procedures to demonstrate the new Government's concern for the popular welfare. The elections were held with secret balloting and freedom of expression and movement for candidates of all parties. The results were accepted as valid because a number of administration opponents were elected, and the people came to feel that the new government was their own, to be supported against the armed rebellion seeking to overthrow it. By 1953, the Huk guerrillas were reduced from 15, 000 to 300. Only 34,000 Filipino troops were employed in military operations against the Huks.

  Magsaysay reinforced his military and national electoral efforts with an administrative innovation whereby any citizen who felt he had a legitimate grievance against the central government, its local provincial officials, of the military was encouraged to wire the details, at a very nominal cost, to the Philippine War Department. All such complaints were investigated without delay and acted on as the facts indicated. Magsaysay also initiated a program of community development in the outlying areas to stimulate local initiative, assisted by the central government, to find cooperative solutions to community social and economic problems. This supplemented and reinforced central government land redistribution programs and other social and economic reforms. Magsaysay also insisted that the Army seek to identify itself with the interests of the peasants and use its resources to further social and economic development wherever possible. These measures were communicated to the people by an effective and imaginative information program.<sup>[[4]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP89B00552R000100040002-3.pdf#page=33)</sup></sup>

- Some historical revisionists refer to a conspiracy theorist blogger, who made waves in the alternative-truth circles, that he obtained a document confirming the US granted immunity to Ashii, and others of unit 731. However, it quotes a section of a May 5, 1982 report from Norman M. Covert. This quoted section only states that the Joint State, War, Navy Coordinating Committee expressed its desire that the information be retained in US hands exclusively and certainly it should be kept from the Soviet Union. The second driving force... was the precondition established by the War Crimes Tribunal in Japan that no prosecutions would be pursued unless a specific incident could be identified and a single person established as the responsible party. This could not be done in LTG Ishii's case. It could not be said that LTG Ishii personally ordered the death of prisoners through experimentation on a particular date using particular agents. This was the result of the US withdrawal from Manchuria and the lack of incriminating evidence from the wealth of material supplied on testing at the Unit."

  Indeed, many historians have upheld this fact: Army historian Edward J. Drea of the Army Center of Military History, “It came down to the problem that prosecutors didn’t have enough evidence for an indictment." Valerie J. Cranmer, "Conscious of the fact they were establishing international criminal precedent, the United States’ case against the Nazi doctors relied on military chain of command to prove strong legal responsibility for human experimentation crimes. In contrast, the United States avoided prosecuting Unit 731 because they could not replicate the same clear legal framework used to successfully prosecute the Nazis." And IWG historians, "the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) thought it lacked definitive evidence to prosecute Ishii and his group at the War Crimes Tribunal." Lawrence Fouraker, on discredited author, Harris, "In general, Harris tends to consider quantity a substitute for quality, as if the sheer volume of footnoted material can compensate for vagueness or even internal contradictions of those sources. This tendency is especially pronounced in the evidence for the "American cover-up."<sup>[[1]](https://networks.h-net.org/node/20904/reviews/21143/fouraker-harris-factories-death-japanese-biological-warfare-1932-1945)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://brill.com/view/journals/jaer/30/1/article-p32_003.xml?language=en)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.archives.gov/files/iwg/reports/final-report-2007.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.archives.gov/files/iwg/japanese-war-crimes/introductory-essays.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- US Fire bombings in Germany and Japan, as well as the use of nuclear weapons fell well within international law at the time As one of the world's leading experts notes, "President Truman’s classification of the bombing as a purely military objective has caused  some  historians to speculate that the President  engaged in “self-deception.”4  Under the mid-twentieth century military’s targeting lexicon, however, the President’s understanding of Hiroshima as a military target was accurate. Although Hiroshima was not a military  base as understood today, it was  a “military city”  as it housed the 2d Army Headquarters, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan. The city was also a communications center, a storage point, and an assembly area for troops...  Nagasaki’s  military  industry  made it significant. The  atomic  bomb  landed between  the two principal targets in the city: the Mitsubishi Steel and Arm Works and  the  Mitsubishi-Uramaki  Ordnance  Works (Torpedo  Works). The atomic strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were lawful under the laws of war existing in 1945. These attacks also represent the only two instances  of  atomic  weapon  strikes in  history. They illustrate the definitional confusion existing with respect  to  the  U.S. classification  of lawful military  objects exclusive of civilian  objects. If some  historians  believe President Truman  was  engaged in “self-deception” in labelling Hiroshima a military target, those historians may be equally perplexed by modern American usage of law-of-war target labels. Under the mid-twentieth century military’s targeting lexicon, however, the President’s understanding of Hiroshima as a military target was accurate."<sup>[[1]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2924907)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://law.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/3567438/Bennett.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.raf.mod.uk/what-we-do/centre-for-air-and-space-power-studies/documents1/air-power-review-vol-13-no-3/)</sup></sup> Further, counter to some historical revisionists, no, the "two nuclear weapons that the United States exploded over Japan ending World War II are not listed [as tests]. These detonations were not “tests” in the sense that they were conducted to prove that the weapon would work as designed (as was the first test near Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945), or to advance nuclear weapon design, or to determine weapons effects, or to verify weapon safety, as were the more than 1,000 tests that have taken place since June 30, 1946."<sup>[[4]](https://www.nnss.gov/docs/docs_librarypublications/doe_nv-209_rev16.pdf)</sup></sup> Academic consensus, the US Bombing survey, and internal records from Japan all but confirm: The nuclear bombs helped end the war.<sup>[[5]](https://docs.rwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=rwu_ebooks)</sup></sup>

  Historical revisionists try to invoke a quote by General Curtis LeMay, "if we lost the war, we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals." This quote is fake. At the Air power and warfare history symposium, in 1978, when asked by a cadet on how much moral considerations affected his decisions regarding the bombing of Japan, LeMay responds: "Killing Japanese didn't bother me very much at that time. It was getting the war over that bothered me. So I wasn't worried particularly about how many people we killed in getting the job done. I suppose if I had lost the war, I would have been tried as a war criminal. Fortunately, we were on the winning side. Incidentally, everybody bemoans the fact that we dropped the atomic bomb and killed a lot of people at Hiroshima and Nagosaki. That I guess is immoral; but nobody says anything about the incendiary attacks on every industrial city in Japan, and the first attack on Tokyo killed more people than the atomic bomb did. Apparently, that was all right. Anyway, at the time we were fighting, we considered we were fighting for our existence, our life, and more or less ethical problems weren't
of primary concern to me, although I didn't discard them completely. For instance, we had to drop leaflets on Japan along with the bombs. This was not a very popular pasttime with my troops. They would rather drop bombs than leaflets. Well, as long as we had to drop them, we decided to drop some of our own. So I found out what the lead time was in getting some leaflets printed up back in Hawaii and then in, canisters out to Guam; and I looked at the target list and the progress we were making, and I picked out ten cities we were going to hit down the road a little bit. Then, we printed up leaflets that, in effect, said, "Look, Mr. Japanese Citizen, we are at war with your country. We are not particularly at war with the Japanese people, per se, but your leadership has got you into this mess, and you are going to be in danger. We are going to destroy the industrial areas of your city. We advise you to seek safety and leave." So, after-we hit the first four cities, the rest of them evacuated to a large extent. I expected them to put antiaircraft around the cities in large numbers, but they didn't. I talked to one of the officers who went in with the strategic bomb survey after the war, and he said that in those particular towns they had an over-abundance of fire engines. One about every 100 yards in the street, burned up along with everything else. I guess the direct answer to your question is, yes, every soldier thinks something of the moral aspects of what he is doing. But all war is immoral, and if you let it bother you, you're not a good soldier."<sup>[[6]](https://ia600205.us.archive.org/21/items/ada-081248/ADA081248.pdf#page=219)</sup></sup> 

  This quote, in full reveals the following: 1. He's referring to his own moral belief, not a legal one; 2. His actions adhered to the laws of war as they existed, by the use of leaflet drops to warn and 3. he never specified about the deaths being civilian or combatant, or a mix of the two—just that the sheer death, may be immoral, but necessary. He never called, or believed any action he did, a war crime.

 
- Between October/November 1901, during the Philippine–American War in the battle of Samar (Battle of Balangiga), General Jacob H. Smith is famously quoted as ordering, “I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn. The more you kill and burn the better you will please me... The interior of Samar must be made a howling wilderness.” When asked by Major Waller asked about the age of those to whom he should apply this guidance, Smith replied that males over ten years old should be considered as being capable of bearing arms. This is cited as evidence that Smith ordered unlawful killings and atrocities against the villagers. This narrative, however, ignores some key facts: When court-martialed for their actions on Samar. Waller would testify that rather than taking the order literally, his interpretation of Smith’s intemperate guidance was, “that the General wanted all insurrectionists killed... people who were bearing arms against Americans... I understood that we were not to  take prisoners if they were armed.” In fact, Waller testified that he cautioned his officers that “we were not sent here to make war on women and children and old men." While smith was seen as ruthless and excessively forceful, "... a circular he issued on 18 November 1901 specifically sought to ensure that accommodating natives were cared for: “Emphasis is laid upon the point that the brigade commander desires not only to permit proper food supplies to reach all friendly natives,  but he particularly desires that these supplies do so reach them." Besides this, Smith was "not tried for issuing illegal orders or for inciting war crimes. Instead, he was charged with 'conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline' for the excessive nature of his orders. A military court headed by Maj. Gen. Loyd Wheaton, who had commanded the Department of North Philippines, that convened in Manila in April 1902 found General Smith guilty of instructing  Waller to “kill and burn” as  much as possible and not take any prisoners. Commenting on this verdict three months later, Secretary of War Elihu Root described the  language Smith was convicted of using as containing “intemperate, inconsiderate, and violent expressions, which, if accepted literally, would grossly violate the humane rules governing American armies in the field.” But the court exercised leniency and sentenced Smith merely to be 'admonished by the reviewing authority.' It  justified this outcome by concluding that Smith “did not mean everything that his unexplained language implied; that his subordinates did not gather such a meaning;  and that the orders were never executed in such sense.” Root commented, “Fortunately they [Smith’s instructions] were not taken literally and were not followed. No  women or children or helpless persons or noncombatants or prisoners were put to death in pursuance of them." Smith was still forced out of the Military for his actions. Others were also convicted and served life in prison for unlawful acts unrelated to Smith.<sup>[[1]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26296824?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents)</sup></sup>

- In 2016, activists and media pundits decried the building of the Dakota Access pipeline, that crosses 4 states. Myths and disinformation ran wild, so here are the facts: The Dakota Access pipeline is not built on Native American reservations. 99.98% of the pipeline is installed on privately owned property in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois. The Dakota Access Pipeline does not enter the Standing Rock Sioux reservation at any point; Eight other pipelines currently run below Lake Oahe. In fact, existing pipelines have safely transported natural gas beneath Lake Oahe for more than 30 years; The Dakota Access Pipeline was approved by regulatory agencies in all four states where the pipeline will operate and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; Tribes were consulted hundreds of times while DAPL route was planned. In developing the route, the United States Army Corps of Engineers had hundreds of contacts with dozens of tribes while the Dakota Access project was reviewed. In addition, the U.S. Army Corps reached out to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe nearly a dozen times to discuss archaeological and other surveys conducted before finalizing the Dakota; The Dakota Access Pipeline has not impacted groundwater in any of the four states through which it passes since going into service in June of 2017; The Dakota Access Pipeline does not encroach on water supply; the Standing Rock Sioux's water intake has been moved to a location about 75 miles away from the pipeline; The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara (MHA) Nation, also known as the Three Affiliated Tribes and located in North Dakota, use the Dakota Access Pipeline to transport more than 60% of the oil they produce; In August of 2018, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed more than a year of additional study of the Dakota Access oil pipeline, saying the work substantiated its earlier determination that the pipeline poses no significant environmental threats; Were tribes consulted on the Dakota Access Pipeline? Yes. The United States Army Corps of Engineers had hundreds of contacts with dozens of tribes while the Dakota Access project was under review. In addition, the U.S. Army Corps reached out to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe nearly a dozen times to discuss archaeological and other surveys conducted before finalizing the pipeline route. During the planning phase, Dakota Access worked with the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Officer and contracted professionally licensed archaeologists to conduct Class II and Class III cultural surveys.<sup>[[1]](https://www.daplpipelinefacts.com/The-Facts.html)</sup></sup> Indeed, as a Court found, "In fact, on this record, it appears that the Corps exceeded its NHPA obligations at many of the PCN sites." The protests cost the state of North Dakota a lot of resources and money. According to local law enforcement, protesters provoked multiple dangerous and criminal confrontations and caused significant damage to property. Additional police were brought in from all over the country to help during the protests. North Dakota's congressional delegation has asked the federal government for $38 million to cover the cost of policing the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Approximately 21 million pounds of trash, debris and waste was ultimately removed from the protest site at Lake Oahe, costing over $1 million in clean up and causing significant concern for the health of the lake. Corps Capt. Ryan Hignight said a total of 8,170 cubic yards of debris was removed from the three camps - Sacred Stone, Oceti Sakowin and Rosebud - all within the flood plain on federally managed land. In 2017, Energy Transfer gifted the state of North Dakota $15 million to help cover costs.<sup>[[2]](https://mwalliancenow.org/news/memorandum-opinion-judge-standing-rock-sioux-tribe-v-us-army-corps-engineers/)</sup></sup>

- In 2015, conspiracy theorists claim that the Chicago Homan Square facility is a "domestic blacksite". This, of course, is nonsense. It never was a secret facility, and people detained their for various crimes can be seen by their own lawyers, or issued a government lawyer, a long established practice the free, Western world. Homan Square is home to CPD’s Evidence and Recovered Property Section, which is open to the public. Homan Square is the only CPD facility where members of the public can collect evidence recovered during a now complete criminal investigation, or found property. Portions of the facility are sensitive. Homan Square is the base of operations for officers working undercover assignments. These men and women dress in plain clothes and work to disrupt gang activity and clear drug markets out of neighborhoods. Advertising their base of operations could put their lives at risk, which is why Homan Square features little signage. Other sensitive units housed at the facility include the Bureau of Organized Crime (including the narcotics unit), the SWAT Unit, Evidence Technicians, and the CPD ballistics lab. Fake allegations claim there is police beatings, and room-controlled temp to force admissions, however, there is no such thing at the facility. Everything about the facility is standard in terms of procedure.<sup>[[1]](https://dig.abclocal.go.com/wls/documents/Homan-Fact-Sheet.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On August 9, 2014, Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson Police Department (“FPD”) shot and killed Michael Brown. Some locals claimed that Brown was innocent of any wrong-doing, and that Officer Darren Wilson, just wanted to kill a black man—did so. However, a fully independent DOJ investigation found that this was a insidious lie, to cover for the heinous act Brown committed: Attempting to steal Officer Darren Wilson's firearm, which, led to a struggle—where Brown brutally punched and scratched Officer Darren Wilson, resulting in the justified shooting of Brown. The witnesses who lied eventually admitted to the independent investigators of their lie—recanting. Some witnesses told the truth, which buttressed Officer Darren Wilson's account of events. The testimony of the Officer Darren Wilson, is also, of course, backed up, fully and completely, by Forensic Science. Another lie maliciously spread accused Officer Darren Wilson of shooting Brown in the back. However, the raw facts debunked such nonsense: There was 0 entrance wounds to Brown’s back.<sup>[[1]](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_shooting_of_michael_brown_1.pdf)</sup></sup> On the 10th anniversary of the incident, Officer Travis Brown was pushed down and beaten by thugs, while doing his community duty: Arresting someone for property damage. Officer Travis Brown now suffers severe brain injury.

However, two inspector general reports found that: Some analysts did target political groups, however, across the political spectrum; it wasn't a deliberate political move; once supervisors learned of the issue, it was remedied and the administration had nothing to do with the rare, honest mistake.

- Conspiracy theorists claim that under the 2012 NDAA, US citizens can be indefinitely detained by the Military, for no reason. However, reading the 2012 NDAA, we find this isn't so. All it did was codify the 2001 AUMF. It should be noted that NDAAs change, but come around every year. Further, not a single example exists to show this has been misused. Sec. 1021 (b) C OVERED PERSONS.—A covered person under this section

(2) A person who was a part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces. Sec. 1022 2) COVERED PERSONS.—The requirement in paragraph (1)

- In an April 2008 a NYT article it was alleged that the DoD used retired military analyst (RMAs) to generate favorable news coverage of the administration’s wartime performance, and that it gave those analysts who had ties to military contractors an unfair opportunity to enhance their business interests. Two investigations were launched in repose to this article, plus a GAO opinion. The GAO opinion finds, "We found no evidence that DOD attempted to conceal from the public its outreach to RMOs or its role in providing RMOs with information, materials, access to department officials, travel, and luncheons. Moreover, we found no evidence that DOD contracted with or paid RMOs for positive commentary or analysis. Consequently, DOD’s public affairs activities involving RMOs, in our opinion, did not violate the publicity or propaganda prohibition."<sup>[[1]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-316443.pdf)</sup></sup> Of the two IG investigations, the first concluded, "we found the evidence insufficient to conclude that RMA outreach activities were improper. Further, we found insufficient basis to conclude that OASD(PA) conceived of or undertook a disciplined effort to assemble a contingent of influential RMAs who could be depended on to comment favorably on DoD programs. With regard to RMAs who had ties to military contractors, extensive searches found no instance where such RMAs used information or contacts obtained as a result of the OASD(PA) outreach program to achieve a competitive advantage for their company. Of the 70 RMAs that we examined, we found that 20 (29 percent) had some type of corporate association. We examined publicly available contracting information involving RMA-affiliated companies to identify any pattern of contract award or contract type that might indicate an irregularity. We did not isolate such a pattern and concluded that further investigative work into this matter was not warranted."<sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20090320221936/http://www.dodig.osd.mil/Inspections/IE/Reports/ExaminationofAllegationsInvolvingDoDOfficeofPublicAffairsOutreachProgram.pdf)</sup></sup>

  The second report found, "The RMA outreach activities were consistent with DOD directives and regulations outlined for the community relations program and the implementation of those activities was not inconsistent with law or regulation. We found the intent of the RMA outreach activities was to provide information to the public through former military members, as credible third party subject matter experts. In implementing the RMA outreach activities, we found that OASD (PA) included a reasonable cross section of media outlets based on our analysis of the in-Pentagon meetings and the travel event."<sup>[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20120605001943/http://www.dodig.mil/Ir/reports/RMATheFinalReport112111redacted.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists have been claiming that between 2007 and 2008, there was misconduct, or corruption by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO), in the handling of the Federal investigation into Geffrey Epstein, by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement (NPA). This has become known as the "sweetheart deal." However, a thorough review by DOJ's OPR found no such corruption or misuse. During the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein's attorney, and filed under seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein attorney Lefkowitz and Villafaña (and others with Acosta and Sloman during September 2007 when the NPA was being finalized, and thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkowitz's side of the communications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafaña's communications to Lefkowitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over Epstein's objections. Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafaña's emails as proof that Villafaña and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein's attorneys to keep the “sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in particular were cited as evidence of the USAO's  improper favouritism towards Epstein. OPR noted, "Because the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other information showing Villafaña’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a public narrative developed that Villafaña colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that narrative to be inaccurate."<sup>[[1]](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/justice-department-review-jeffrey-epstein/41c1a927e0acff76/full.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists distort what Operation Fast and Furious was, claiming, without evidence, that the US Government was secretly smuggling guns to cartels, or drugs, to Mexico. This, however, is just fake news. Fast and Furious was an investigation. Nothing more. Its origins date back to 2006. Independent investigations by the 2012 House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; a DOJ Inspector General, and a DHS Inspector General found It was not authorised by leadership in Washington DC—rather, the ATF’s Phoenix Field Division, nor were the investigative strategies employed approved/briefed to senior leadership. The Field Division allowed guns to be purchased, as part of their investigative efforts—however, struggled to seize the weapons after purchase due to legal/bureaucratic hurdles, disagreements and failure to reassess the situation.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20160819171133/http://democrats.oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/Fast%20and%20Furious.Minority%20Report.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Mgmt/2013/OIG_13-49_Mar13.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/441887/ig-report-fast-and-furious.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/ATF/e1101.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Claims that Bush "suspended" habeas corpus have 0 basis in reality. "The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA) and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) further narrowed the scope of habeas relief, providing that prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay may not access the federal courts through habeas corpus; instead, they must go through the military commissions and then seek appeal in the D.C. Circuit Court. However, the Supreme Court in Boumediene v. Bush (2008) expanded the territorial reach of habeas corpus, ruling that the Suspension Clause affirmatively guaranteed the right to habeas review. Thus, alien detainees designated as enemy combatants who were held outside the United States had the constitutional right to habeas corpus."<sup>[[1]](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/habeas_corpus)</sup></sup>  Detainees were able to file habeas corpus from their arrival. <sup>[[2]](https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/01_David-Kris.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On May 6, 2002, the US opposed the ICC because it suffers from a number structural flaws. At the same time, the US proposed alternatives that already exist: "Domestic Accountability: Encourage states to create credible justice institutions in their own state rather than abdicating responsibility to an international body. Where domestic legal institutions are lacking, but domestic will is present, the international community must be prepared to assist in creating the capacity for the sovereign state to address the violations. This includes political, financial, legal, and logistical support. Where domestic will is non-existent, the international community can intervene through the UN Security Council, consistent with the UN Charter. Ad hoc international mechanisms may be created under the auspices of the UN Security Council, as was done to establish the international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Additionally, hybrid courts consisting of international participants and the affected state’s participants can be authorized, such as in the case of Sierra Leone."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20031129170524/http://www.usembassy.at/en/download/pdf/icc_pa.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Further, Per the ICC, "The International Criminal Court is _not a substitute_ for national courts. According to the Rome Statute, it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes. The International Criminal Court _can only intervene where a State is unable or unwilling genuinely to carry out the investigation and prosecute the perpetrators"_<sup>[[2]](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/Publications/understanding-the-icc.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Within the first 100 days of the tragic attack on 9/11, President Bush moved swiftly to protect Muslims from hate crimes and the Department of Justice followed his lead by having their Civil Rights Division sponsor community forums in Chicago, Illinois, and Dearborn, Michigan, on combating ethnically motivated violence as a result of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Attorney General John Ashcroft and AAG for Civil Rights Ralph F. Boyd, Jr. have met with 29 prominent leaders from the Arab and Muslim American and Sikh communities and underscored DOJ’s strong commitment to investigate and prosecute violators of federal hate crime laws.

  The Department of Justice, the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor issued a joint statement against employment discrimination in the aftermath of September 11. Investigating approximately 300 incidents involving violence, or threats of violence against individuals perceived to be of Middle Eastern origin. Federal charges have been brought in 6 cases, coordinating with local prosecutors in at least ten instances where cases are being prosecuted locally.<sup>[[1]](https://2001-2009.state.gov/s/ct/rls/wh/6947.htm)</sup></sup>
  
- Immediately after 9/11, indeed, within 3 months, law enforcement arrested people connected to the PENTTBOM investigation. In total, 762 aliens were under their violation of Immigration laws. During this time, they were manually reviewed by the FBI and released. While intended to be no more than a few days detained, the average was 80 days. The highest arrests were within the same week of the terror attacks. By December 2001, there was a sharp decline of arrests. Further, the vast majority of detainees held were treated like any other case. However, a few were roughly treated at NY's Brooklyn Metro Detention Center, by a handful of officers. MDC management installed cameras into teach 9/11 detainee's cell, and record all interactions between cells, to make sure they were not abused—or capture evidence if it did occur. <sup>[[1]](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/special/0306/full.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Section 412 of the Patriot Act, requires the detention of aliens who are certified as threats to the national security, pending their removal from the United States. An extremely narrow class of aliens can be detained under section 412. There must be “reasonable grounds to believe” that the alien: (1) entered the United States to violate espionage or sabotage laws; (2) entered to oppose the government by force; (3) engaged in terrorist activity; or (4) endangers the United States’ national security. Section 412 expressly grants aliens the right to challenge their detention in court. Aliens may file a habeas petition in any federal district court that has jurisdiction. Once the Attorney General has taken a certified alien into custody, he has seven days to initiate removal proceedings or file criminal charges. If the Attorney General does neither, he is required to release the alien. If an alien has been detained “solely” under section 412, and his removal is unlikely in the foreseeable future, the Attorney General “may” continue to detain him for additional periods of up to six months. Additional detention periods are authorized only if releasing the alien “will” threaten national security or cause harm to “the community or any person.”<sup>[[2]](https://ia904700.us.archive.org/35/items/PAMyths/449089.pdf#page=30)</sup></sup>

- Jeffrey Sterling contacted a reporter in early 2003, claiming that the CIA incidentally aided Iran's nuclear weapons development in a covert program. The NYT declined to run the story because of concerns for the safety of human sources. Sterling had a personal axe to grind against the CIA, as he alleged that he was racially discriminated against by colleagues. However, an independent investigation found this allegation baseless. He took this issue to court, but backed off when the Court said it would require CIPA to review classified information—he clearly knew he didn't have a case. As for the core operation itself: A Russian scientist had been an asset for the CIA since 1994—by 1998, the CIA began plans to deceive Iran's nuclear program via the following: Merlin provided designs on Soviet nuclear weapon parts such as the fire set. From there, CIA examined the design and altered many components to cause total failure. The goal was to delay Iran's covert WMD program. The design plans were then prototyped and tested by two independent teams unaware of the modifications. The team's collective experience totalled more than 200 years. They then tried to fix the mechanism if they discovered any flaws. Tests were all successful. In 2000, Merlin traveled to Vienna and met with Iranian contacts. The rest of the operation is all classified.<sup>[[1]](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/sterling/govt-exh-399.pdf)</sup></sup> Sterling was last involved in the program in May 2000 and in Jan of 2002, Sterling was fired from the Agency. His allegations that this operation backfired are without merit, as it would be impossible for him to know. In 2006, the journalist he approached, wrote a book, publishing these activities. Merlin and his wife were so concerned that Russia or Iran could discover their identities, and capturing them for torture and kill them, the wife would jump in fear at every little noise at night.<sup>[[2]](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/sterling/govt-exh-406.pdf#page=32)</sup></sup> Thankfully, Sterling lost the appeal and spent years in prison for this serious breach of ethics and obstruction of justice. <sup>[[3]](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/sterling/062217-appeal.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Over the years, it has been alleged by conspiracy theorists that the CIA has misled Congress on various matters. One such cited example is the case of Richard Barlow, a Foreign Affairs Specialist while at DoD. In 1993, a Congressionally-mandated Joint Inspectors General investigation between CIA, DoD and State, found that 1. He had made no such disclosure to Congress, but said Congress was misled to a coworker. 2 He was not terminated from his position for allegedly making a disclosure to Congress, suffering reprisal—that the decision for employment termination was made well before the alleged disclosure took place. 3. That the allegation was in error in the first place. "The OIG report concluded that no one at CIA or the NIC ever deliberately provided false or misleading information to Congress regarding Pakistan's nuclear program." It also found, "on those few occasions when an Agency or NIC officer may have made an honest misstatement during Congressional testimony, the Agency quickly corrected the record without prompting from any other quarter." While the GAO review, while not saying the Joint report was wrong, suggests its logic wasn't fully supported by the evidence. However, the GAO failed to address the criticism by management that points out, as previously stated, that the termination decision had already been made prior to the communication.<sup>[[1]](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/statesec/barlow-tenet.pdf#page=13)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20081211034006/http://archive.gao.gov/paprpdf1/158991.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Ruby Ridge. Conspiracy theorists claim that the terrorist was targeted by ATF for his beliefs, and that they deliberately killed for "muh reasons." However, an independent review by the RRTF confirm this wasn't the case. This investigation did find issues in the FBI's handling of the initial investigation, but found, "no evidence that these deficiencies were international or that the FBI staged evidence for the prosecution's benefit." It also found issues with Assistant AG Ronald Howen taking questionable acts, it recommended that the Executive Office for US Attorneys examine their findings. However, overall, "this investigation found no evidence that BATF improperly targeted Weaver because of his religious or political beliefs. Similarly, we found insufficient evidence to sustain the charge that Weaver was illegally entrapped into selling the weapons." The investigation also examined the snipers: "an FBI sniper/observer fired two shots in quick succession. The first shot was at an armed adult male whom he believed was about to fire at a HRT helicopter on an observation mission. The first shot wounded Randy Weaver while in front of a building at the Weaver compound known as the birthing shed. The second shot was fired at Harris while Harris was retreating into the Weaver cabin. The second shot seriously wounded Harris and killed Vicki Weaver who was behind the cabin door. It is our conclusion that the sniper/observer who took the second shot intended to shoot Kevin Harris but accidentally killed Vicki Weaver whom he did not see behind the curtained door. We concluded that the first shot met the standard of "objective reasonableness" the Constitution requires for the legal use of deadly force."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/report-on-ruby-ridge_202405)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/rubyridgeBerman)</sup></sup> OPR found, "the second shot was justified in view of the totality of the circumstances."<sup>[[3]](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/special/0211/final.pdf#page=42)</sup></sup>

   Regarding Horiuchi: the DOJ Civil Rights Division concluded the evidence was insufficient to justify a prosecution. The findings of the Civil Rights Division, after substantial further investigation, by the Ruby Ridge criminal investigative team, reached the same conclusion: there is not sufficient evidence to obtain or sustain a conviction for violation of the federal civil rights statutes for the shooting of Vicki Weaver, Randall Weaver, or Kevin Harris. In essence, the critical element of willfulness necessary for a civil rights violation cannot be established beyond a reasonable doubt.  Such willfulness, or knowing, intentional use of unreasonable force cannot be made out against FBI Agent Lon Horiuchi, who fired the shots which struck Randall Weaver, Vicki Weaver, and Kevin Harris, since those shots were within the guidelines set forth by his superiors in the rules of engagement. There was also no evidence from which it could be concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Horiuchi actually saw Vicki Weaver at the time he fired the shot that killed her. Moreover, it was concluded that such willfulness could not be established against the on-site supervisors responsible for drafting and implementing the rules of engagement and other tactics at Ruby Ridge. In summary, the little circumstantial evidence from which it could be argued that there may have been an intent to use more force than was necessary was far outweighed by a significant amount of evidence that law enforcement had no such intention here. Instead, there was substantial evidence that FBI law enforcement efforts were undertaken by on-site supervisors with the belief that Randall Weaver and Kevin Harris posed a severe threat to law enforcement officers requiring the use of deadly force.<sup>[[4]](https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/1997/August97/337crm.htm)</sup></sup>
  
   However, Horiuchi was prosecuted by the State of Idaho. Initially, Horiuchi won dismissal based on Supremacy Clause immunity. This was overturned. This wasn't because the Appeals Court found guilt. The Court writes, "Agent Horiuchi is not entitled to dismissal on the ground of Supremacy Clause immunity at this stage in the proceeding. On remand, the district court may conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the evidence supports Agent Horiuchi's entitlement to immunity under the legal principles applicable to the use of deadly force.

- All the wild conspiracy theories about Inslaw's PROMIS software, ranging from covert action to assassination of a freelance journalist, has been debunked in two landmark investigations by an independent Special Counsel, and several Congressional investigations.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/doj-oip-inslaw-1993)</sup></sup>

- In 1993, a cultist group known as the Branch Davidians, in Waco Texas, shot at law enforcement as they attempted to serve a search and arrest warrant on the ranch and started a fire in the compound. Conspiracy theorists and pundits have claimed it was the ATF that caused the fire & that the Feds were illegally/unconstitutionally targeting the group. Both of these claims have been debunked by several independent investigations. A review finds, "Some also have expressed concern about whether ATF was motivated inappropriately to focus a federal firearms investigation of Koresh because of its concerns about his alleged sexual abuse of children and his polygamy. Others have asked whether ATF selected Koresh improperly for investigation because of his nontraditional religious beliefs and practices. These criticisms are not supported by the evidence. A review of the investigation makes it clear that the ATF inquiry into the activities of Koresh and his followers was consistent with the agency's congressional mandate to enforce federal laws regulating the possession and manufacture of automatic weapons and explosive devices. Indeed, ATF would have been remiss if it had permitted considerations of religious freedom to insulate the Branch Davidians from such an investigation. Even after ATF assistance was sought, ATF agents did not formally open an investigation until making a preliminary determination that federal crimes were being committed. Special Agent Aguilera debriefed local officials and then searched national firearms registries. When Aguilera learned that neither Koresh nor his followers were registered owners of any lawful machineguns, but nevertheless were receiving shipments of machinegun parts and paying for them with large quantities of cash, he reasonably grew suspicious that they were engaged in the illegal manufacture of machineguns. Upon learning that Koresh had received a shipment of materials used to manufacture explosives, specifically grenades, Aguilera formally opened an ATF case in early June 1992.

  While some have suggested that ATF targeted Koresh because of his religious beliefs and life-style, the Review has found no evidence of any such motivation. Indeed, ATF recognized early the delicacy of an investigation of such an unorthodox community. Aguilera's supervisors appropriately classified the case as "sensitive," thus ensuring greater supervisory scrutiny of a case that was perceived at the outset to have the potential for raising thorny religious issues as well as difficult safety issues, particularly regarding the women and children living at the Compound."<sup>[[1]](https://ia600409.us.archive.org/31/items/reportofdepartme00unit_202406/reportofdepartme00unit.pdf#page=141)</sup></sup>

  
  Title III intercepts, admissions by survivors, and forensic analysis all put beyond dispute: the Davidians started the fire. A 1993 review finds: "The arson team concluded that the fire was deliberately set by one or more persons inside the compound. The fire had three separate points of origin. The arson investigation established that those fires occurred in areas significantly distant from one another, but within such a short time frame that it was not possible for the fire to have been accidentally set or for it to have been caused by a single ignition. The arson team then discussed those factors that enhanced the spread of the fire. First, the team noted that the compound building had been poorly construction, with apparently no attention to fire safety. The team noted that the building "appears to have been built with a total disregard to any reasonable concern for fire prevention, especially considering its intended use as living quarters for numerous people." Second, the arson team attributed the rapid spread of the fire to the strong winds prevailing on April 19. Third, the arson team found that the openings created in the building's structure by the FBI during the six hours of the tear gas operation also helped vent the fire. However, the team also noted that the FBI's actions would have allowed more fresh air to flow through the structure while it was burning, thereby reducing the concentration of carbon monoxide and permitting more "breathable" air to reach those trapped inside. Fourth, the unusually large amount of combustible material stored inside the compound contributed to the rapid spread of the fire. Finally, the absence of fire suppression was a minor factor. The arson team explained that given a fire of this intensity and magnitude, it would have been difficult for a fire fighting team to have halted the fire.

  Finally, the arson team addressed whether the fire could have been started by the FBI's deployment of tear gas into the compound. The team concluded that "the fire was not caused by nor was it intensified by any chemicals present in the tear-gassing operations." The team noted that the two methods used to deliver the gas were non-incendiary. The pressurized gas delivered through the combat engineering vehicles was sprayed through a nozzle using carbon dioxide as the propellant. The team noted that carbon dioxide would be incapable of igniting, and might even have acted as a fire inhibiting agent. The other method -- 40 mm Ferret cartridges delivered by an M79 hand-held launcher containing a nonburning, nonexplosive liquid agent containing methylene chloride as the carrier -- could not have had any incendiary effect either. The arson team likewise concluded that, given the multiple simultaneous points of origin, the fire could not possibly have been started by a ferret round entering a window and knocking over a container of flammable liquid. Moreover, the arson team concluded (contrary to a theory that has been advanced by certain people) that the fire could not have been started by one of the combat engineering vehicles rupturing a propane container and igniting it. If that had happened, according to the report, "an immediate vapor air explosion or flash fire would have occurred involving the vehicle itself. It did not happen." 
 
  In addition to the arson investigation, which focused on the cause and origin of the fire, two experts from the University of Maryland's Department of Fire Protection Engineering traveled to Waco to investigate how the fire had developed and spread. Those two experts prepared a written "Fire Development Analysis" dated September 8, 1993. They reached the following conclusions: 1. The fires in each of the three points of origin grew very quickly, each resulting in full room involvement within two minutes of initiation. 2. The rapid growth rates of the fires resulted from an ignition source, probably liquid fuel, deliberately placed in each of the three points of origin. 3. The rapid growth rates of the fires could not have been caused by a CEV accidentally tipping a lantern, nor by the chemical (methylene chloride) used as the dispersal agent for the CS tear gas. 4. The strong winds did not significantly affect the fire growth rates inside the compound. The wind affected the external spread of flames, but not the initial rapid growth of the three fires to full room involvement. 5. The tank-made openings on the first floor of the compound could have had some effect on the fire growth, but more likely provided fresh air to areas of refuge for some of the occupants. 6. The compound residents had sufficient time to escape the fire, if they had so desired."<sup>[[2]](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/doj/legacy/2014/09/15/wacorpt.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/evaluation-of-the-handling-of-the-branch)</sup></sup> 

  In 2000, the Office Of Special Counsel filed a final report regarding Waco. The investigation lasted 14 months, employed 74 personnel, and cost approximately $17 million. The Office of Special Counsel interviewed exactly 1,001 witnesses, reviewed over 2.3 million pages of documents, and examined thousands of pounds of physical evidence—and retained several world-leading experts from across the globe—each of which issued reports attached to the OSC review. "As a result of this effort, the Special Counsel states the following conclusions with certainty: The government of the United States and its agents are not responsible for the April 19, 1993, tragedy at Waco: (a) did not cause the fire; (b) did not direct gunfire at the Branch Davidian complex; and (c) did not improperly employ the armed forces of the United States. Responsibility for the tragedy of Waco rests with certain of the Branch Davidians and their leader, Vernon Howell, also known as David Koresh, who: (a) shot and killed four ATF agents on February 28, 1993, and wounded 20 others; (b) refused to exit the complex peacefully during the 51-day standoff that followed the ATF raid despite extensive efforts and concessions by negotiators for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”); (c) directed gunfire at FBI agents who were inserting tear gas into the complex on April 19, 1993; (d) spread fuel throughout the main structure of the complex and ignited it in at least three places causing the fire which resulted in the deaths of those Branch Davidians not killed by their own gunfire; and (e) killed some of their own people by gunfire, including at least five children. Government agents did not start or materially contribute to the spread of the fire. During the morning of April 19, 1993, several Davidians spread accelerants throughout the main structure of the complex, and started fires in several locations. The evidence indicates that many of the Davidians did not want to escape the fire. Indeed, while government agents risked their lives to save Davidians from the fire, one Davidian tried to re-enter the burning complex to die. When an FBI agent questioned this Davidian regarding the location of the children, the Davidian refused to answer. A Davidian who exited the complex during the fire stated that he witnessed others make no effort to leave the complex. Another Davidian expressed remorse that she had not perished in the fire with the rest of the group." 

  Among the evidence that the terrorists started the fire was Title III intercepts: "Davidian conversations intercepted through the use of concealed listening devices inside the complex from April 17 to April 19 indicate that the Davidians started the fire. An April 17 intercept records Davidians discussing how they could prevent fire trucks from reaching the complex. An April 18 intercept records a conversation between Steven Schneider and other Davidians indicating a conspiracy to start a fire. During that conversation, Schneider joked that another Davidian had always wanted to be a “charcoal briquette.” Another Davidian stated that, “I know there’s nothing like a good fire . . . .” On April 19, between the beginning of the tear gas insertion operation at approximately 6:00 a.m. and approximately 7:25 a.m., the Title III intercepts recorded the following statements: “Need fuel;” “Do you want it poured?;” “Have you poured it yet?;” “Did you pour it yet?;” “David said pour it right?;” “David said we have to get the fuel on;” “We want the fuel;” “They got some fuel around here;” “Have you got the fuel . . . the fuel ready?;” “I’ve already poured it;” “It’s already poured;” “Yeah . . . we’ve been pouring it;” “Pouring it already;” “Real quickly you can order the fire yes;” “You got to put the fuel in there too;” “We’ve got it poured already;” “Is there a way to spread fuel in here?;” “So we only light it first when they come in with the tank right . . . right as they’re coming in;” “That’s secure . . . we should get more hay in here;” “You have to spread it so get started ok?” These statements precede the sighting of fire by several hours, which is further proof that the Davidians intended to set fire to the complex well in advance of actually lighting the fires. Much closer to the time of the fire, from approximately 11:17 a.m. to 12:04 p.m., Title III intercepts recorded the following statements from inside the complex: “Do you think I could light this soon?;” “I want a fire on the front . . . you two can go;” “Keep that fire going . . . keep it.” The only plausible explanation for these comments is that some of the Davidians were executing their plan to start a fire."

  Other evidence from the cult: "Davidians who survived the fire have acknowledged that other Davidians started the fire. Graeme Craddock told the Office of Special Counsel in 1999 that he observed other Davidians pouring fuel in the chapel area of the complex on April 19, 1993. He further stated that he saw another Davidian, Mark Wendel, arrive from the second floor yelling: “Light the fire.” Davidian Clive Doyle told the Texas Rangers on April 20, 1993, that Davidians had spread Coleman fuel in designated locations throughout the complex, although he declined to state who specifically lit the fires."

  As for gunshots, the OSC finds, "In summary, those claiming that government gunfire did occur have presented an unsupportable case based entirely upon flawed technological assumptions. The FLIR tapes and testing, witness interviews, including those of Davidians, documentary evidence, audio and video evidence, photographs, autopsy reports, polygraph examinations, ballistics testing, and basic tactical and behavioral considerations provide conclusive evidence that no agent of the United States fired gunshots at Waco on April 19, 1993. The eyewitness evidence and physical evidence are equally overwhelming that the Davidians shot repeatedly at the government on April 19 and that 20 Davidians either committed suicide or were shot by other Davidians as the fire broke out just after noon on April 19."<sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/danforthreport-final)</sup></sup> In September 2001, Frankel, Donald S, retained by the Committee on Government Reform, also examined the FLIR, and reached the same conclusions as the OSC's expert teams. "The flashes seen on the tape cannot be weapons muzzle flash. Their duration is far too long and their spatial extent is far too great. They are almost certainly the result of solar energy or heat energy form nearby vehicles reflected toward the FLIR by debris or puddles."<sup>[[5]](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001SPIE.4370..286F/abstract)</sup></sup>

  Lastly, some revisionists may try reference the GOP report on the matter, as evidence of wrongdoing regarding a supposed "coverup". However, a thorough review found its core allegations simply not supported. The GOP here omitted and misrepresented evidence. It basically was a report of conjecture. The bottom-line conclusion it found, "it contributes virtually nothing to the public’s understanding of Waco. Many of the report’s findings duplicate those of the Special Counsel, John C. Danforth. In his report, Danforth determined, among other things, that government agents did not cause or contribute to the fire that consumed the Branch Davidian compound on April 19, 1993, did not direct gunfire at the Branch Davidians on April 19, and did not unlawfully employ U.S. armed forces at any time during the standoff. To the extent the majority report deviates from Danforth’s findings, it consists largely of unsupported allegations of wrongdoing by the Attorney General and Justice Department officials."<sup>[[7]](https://archive.org/details/waco-cmte)</sup></sup>


- The matter concerning the events on May 13, 1985 in Philadelphia have been grossly whitewashed by activists and historical revisionists—that MOVE was unjustly "bombed" by police. However, despite distortions, there were two investigations. One of which, an earth-shattering investigation conducted by a Special Grand Jury, have slammed the narrative pushed by the terror group. The distortion of history also extends to allegations that police prevented MOVE members from fleeing, that the decision to blow a hole in the roof was reckless and negligent, that MOVE was an innocent group, etc. To further this narrative, special interest groups selectively quote from the two principle investigations—while omitting the surrounding text. In order to correct the historical record, the following are quotes from the reports. One was a citizens commission—which heard limited testimony, and limited evidence. This report had a strong dissenting section by a former Judge. His dissent was independently supported by a more thorough Special Grand Jury investigation. The black Mayor actually put the MOVE group above the law, by permitting the thugs their criminal act—under a policy of nonconfrontation, as he was afraid they'd lash out and kill again. MOVE members were violent and disruptive. Vile acts include, but not limited to: Beating up random locals; threatening to kill locals and public officials; creating an infestation of bugs and rodents; climbing on surrounding rooftops and damaging property; blocking residents from their own homes, etc. The group became more hostile to provoke a confrontation with police.

  The morning of May 13th:

  If MOVE declined to permit peaceful service of the arrest and search warrants which had been obtained, the first step was to activate the Fire Department's squirt hoses. Their purpose was to direct water onto the compound's roof to minimize of eliminate the bunker's strategic advantage. At the same time, the two insertion teams would proceed, under cover of smoke and tear gas, into the two properties adjoining the MOVE compound, 6219 and 6223 Osage Avenue. Once inside these houses, the teams were to make three-inch holes in the basement and second floor party walls. Through these holes tear gas would be inserted into 6221 using pepper foggers. This insertion of gas into 6221's lowest and highest floors was intended to first drive its occupants to the first floor and then cause their surrender. The police operation actually began at daybreak; by then all units and men were in their assigned positions. The Police Commissioner, using an amplification system from inside Post One at 6218 Osage Avenue, advised MOVE of the outstanding warrants and allowed them fifteen minutes to surrender. MOVE did not cooperatively respond. A voice on MOVE's loudspeaker yelled, "You're going to be laying in the street, bleed we're going to k*ll you com where you stay, where you lay. We see you on the roof. We know you're in those houses." After the time ran out, police teams breached, and were fired upon by MOVE thugs. The police response to MOVE was measured and deliberate. The police plan allowed only a controlled discharge of firearms. Unless in direct danger, no officer was permitted to fire without relaying information about his situation to Marandola through the Stake Out supervisor located in each post. Orders to shoot were given by Marandola in Post One; the majority of the orders to fire during the day were given by Marandola through the respective post commanders. 

  First, we consider the police gunfire directed at 6221 Osage Avenue. The sheer number of rounds directed at the compound, with the children inside, led a majority of the MOVE Commission to term police gunfire "unconscionable" This finding is inappropriate given the well-considered gunfire control plan devised by the police to minimize danger to anyone other than the armed resisters. The designers of the operation had developed a contingency plan in case, as actually occurred, MOVE responded to the surrender order with gunfire. Police could not initiate any firing and, moreover, could fire back only with express approval from Marandola unless an officer's life was in imminent danger. Even after gaining approval from Marandola, an officer could only fire at combatants who were actually firing at the police. Police adhered to these instructions, firing only in response to MOVE gunshots directed at the insertion teams or posts, and aiming only at MOVE gun positions. Thus, when Ramona Africa became visible in the front of the compound during the afternoon, Marandola ordered police to hold their fire because she was not then shooting at police. The only flaw in this fire control procedure was the absence of a mechanism to stop the gunfire beyond Marandola's intermittent cease fire orders. The MOVE Commission found that police fired over 10,000 rounds at the MOVE compound. This number is erroneous. Unquestionably, police checked 9,400 rounds of ammunition out of the pistol range that were not returned and borrowed ammunition from other sources. That amount, however, is not reflective of how many rounds were fired by police as it includes large amounts of unfired ammunition which exploded after being abandoned in the police posts which caught fire. For example, Marandola alone abandoned 1,000 rounds of M-16 ammunition when he evacuated Post One. The sheer number of rounds, however, does not make this police action criminal. The fact remains that gunfire was directed only at combatants and only while they fired on police. The number of bullets does not change the nature of the conduct: All police gunfire was a justified response to MOVE gunfire.

  The use of the satchel charge:

  The stated purpose of the satchel charge was to create a hole in the roof through which police could pump tear gas. Shortly after the explosion a small roof fire became evident. Sambor and Richmond subsequently made an on-the-scene, tactical decision -- which they did not communicate to Brooks or Goode --to permit this fire to burn. They hoped the fire would accomplish what the charge had not: The destruction of the bunker. The fire did eliminate the bunker, but not in the manner intended. Instead of burning the bunker above the roof line, the fire weakened the roof and, at 6:21 p.m., the flaming bunker fell into the second floor of 6221. The moment that the fire spread to the interior of the house it could no longer be fought without grave risk to fire fighters. Extinguishing the blaze with hand-held lines, however, was too risky because MOVE members might shoot at fire fighters as they had in 1978. This significant danger prevented the Fire Department from actively fighting the fire for several hours. In that interim, the Fire Department did attempt to contain the fire to the MOVE compound, but was not successful. MOVE members and children remained in the house for nearly two hours as the fire grew in intensity. Ultimately, only Ramona and Michael escaped. The others apparently chose to remain inside, or left and then returned to the compound, where they died.

  Allowing the fire: 

  Because the Fire Department could not fight an interior fire so long as MOVE members remained in the house, the moment that the fire progressed to the second floor it became uncontrollable. There is no evidence, however, that Sambor was aware of or understood this risk, let alone that he consciously disregarded it. To the contrary, he was aware that Fire Department personnel -- including the Fire Commissioner himself -- and fire-fighting equipment were at the scene. Most importantly, he specifically asked the Fire Commissioner whether the fire could be controlled if it were permitted to burn the bunker and was told that it could be. Recklessness, as defined by the Crimes Code, also requires an assessment of the nature and intent of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to him. Here, Sambor's intent was to disable the bunker, thereby destroying MOVE's tactical advantage and enabling police to pump tear gas into the house through the roof. This purpose was plainly lawful.

  The back alley: Because of the special powers of the Grand Jury and the cooperation secured from many previously uncooperative witnesses, we had access to substantial testimony and evidence about the evening occurrences in the back alley which previously was unavailable to either the media or the MOVE Commission. We also largely were able to avoid relying on some of the hearsay evidence upon which the MOVE Commission had to rely. These factors, among others, now allow us to state unequivocally (1) that the back alley gun battle reported by the media did not occur, (2) that police gunfire did not prevent occupants of the MOVE house from escaping or cause injury of death to them. Having heard and considered all of this testimony, we reject any contention or conclusion that a pitched gun battle, of any sort, between the police and MOVE members occurred in the back alley. Such a finding is absolutely inconsistent with the vast weight of the extensive evidence presented to us. Moreover, against all of this testimony regarding sounds consistent with gunfire, not one witness testified that he saw any police officer fire a weapon in the alley on the evening of May 13, 1985. Nor did any officer admit such action even though some officers testified with immunity and, thus, could freely have admitted to firing at MOVE. It is our conclusion that the extent of the gunfire in the back alley was limited to between four to ten rifle shots fired by an unidentified male MOVE member.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/grand-jury-movereport)</sup></sup>

  The MOVE Commission:

  The majority report finds " that MOVE was an "authoritarian, violence-threatening cult ... (whose members placed themselves above the laws of society and threatened violence to anyone who would enforce normal societal rules. That MOVE was an "armed and dangerous" group whose members "used threats, abuse and intimidation to terrify their neighbours and to bring about confrontation with City government." That the death of officer Ramp and the wounding of many police and fire fighters in the 1978 clash confirmed that MOVE members would use deadly force when confronted. That MOVE publicly acclaimed its 1978 murder of Police officer James Ramp and made repeated threats that, if police came to 6221 Osage Ave, 'we'll put a bullet in your motherf*cking heads'." That MOVE committed violent acts against its own neighbors and threatened violence against public officials and private citizens. That MOVE terrorized its neighbors by an aggressive display of weapons. That MOVE gave public notice of imminent confrontation by its construction of a rooftop bunker which gave MOVE compelling domination of the neighborhood. That MOVE plainly showed that the Mayor's policy of appeasement, non-confrontation, and avoidance was doomed to fail when MOVE began barricading its house, including putting slats on all the windows. That the fortification of the rooftop granted to the occupants a critical tactical advantage over the block, and over the Police.

  That the police were entitled to use deadly force on May 13 is manifest. They were attempting to serve lawfully executed warrants upon persons this Commission has found to be armed, dangerous, terroristic, and dedicated to provoking a violent confrontation with authority. When the police approached 6221 Osage, MOVE members announced over a loudspeaker that they would resist arrest with deadly force, that they would kill those who sought to enforce the law, and that they would not come out of the house. Immediately after smoke and gas shells were fired into 6221 Osage, MOVE opened fire on the police. There is no credible evidence that any adult MOVE member was prevented from leaving the house voluntarily. Use of deadly force in these circumstances was lawful and appropriate.

  Kauffman dissents in some areas, such as alleged racism, allegations of police prevention of escapees to flee. His findings here were corroborated by the Grand Jury investigation: "I emphasize that this Commission has not found that the police were unjustified in the use of any deadly force. The majority simply concludes that 10,000 rounds were too many. While assuming the role of critic, the majority does not state how many rounds or what type of weapons would have been appropriate in the battlefield conditions MOVE had created. Would they have approved 5,000 rounds? 2,000? 500? Where would they, through hindsight, draw that arbitrary line? I refuse to join this criticism which is grossly unfair and unwarranted." The events in the alley: The majority of this Commission has found that police gunfire prevented some occupants of 6221 Osage Ave. from escaping from the burning house to the rear alley." I disagree that the evidence supports such a conclusion. Two sources supplied the Commission with first hand testimony regarding what transpired in the alley: the police in the alley, and Michael Ward. The police have testified consistently that after the bomb was dropped, they fired no shots in the alley, nor did they see or hear other police fire their weapons. Although they heard 22 caliber weapons fire, they believed these shots were fired by MOVE members. (See, e.g., testimony of Officer Louis Mount, Walter Washington, James Berghaier). Significantly, the noise from the raging fire was so great that some police officers said that they could not hear any shots. (See, e.g., testimony of Officers Terrance Mulvihill and Lawrence D'Ulisse, 10/31/85 at 30•47). The police also testified consistently regarding surrender attempts of those inside the house. According to the police, there was only one such attempt. Although the officers' versions vary slightly, it appears that at approximately 7:30 p.m., they saw three children and an adult woman leaving the house. Closely following this group was an adult male with a rifle. He fired several shots at the police who did not return fire because of his proximity to the woman and children. (See testimony of Sergeants Donald Griffiths and William Trudell and Officer Marcus Bariana, 10/31/85 at 145-65). The evidence to the contrary is far from sufficient to convince me to disbelieve the police. 

  Most significantly, both the police and Michael agreed that when he surrendered, neither he nor the others leaving the house with him were fired upon by anyone. (See testimony of Michael Ward, 10/31/85 at 365-66). This critical fact strongly corroborates the police version of the events in the alley. Finally, the record clearly confirms that Officer James Berghaier exposed himself to gunfire and risked his life to save Michael from drowning after he fled from 6221. (See testimony of Officers James Berghaier and Michael Tursi, 11/1/85 at 107 et seq.). This heroic act is totally inconsistent with any police attempt to fire on those MOVE members and children who tried to surrender. 

  Alleged racism in decision making: Without a scintilla of factual support, the majority of this Commission has accused the Mayor, the former Managing Director, the former Police Commissioner, and the Fire Commissioner of racism. I fear that this unfounded accusation will prove needlessly divisive and will profoundly undermine the Commission's credibility I have joined with the majority in virtually all of their factual findings, abundantly supported by the evidence, relating to failures of leadership and errors of judgment. Although I deeply respect the sincerity of their beliefs, I cannot join the majority in this exceptionally inflammatory accusation based on nothing but surmise, conjecture, speculation, and suspicion. Mayor Goode may have his shortcomings, but I simply do not believe that he is a racist. Nor do I believe that race was a factor in any of the decisions that he made on or leading up to May 13. The same is true of former Managing Director Brooks, former Police Commissioner Sambor and Fire Commissioner Richmond. On May 13, 1985, a black Mayor and a black Managing Director were responsible for the City's operation against a black terrorist group holding a black neighborhood hostage. The tragic events of that day were caused, purely and simply, by incompetence, bad judgment, and other errors. These inadequacies know no racial boundaries and, unfortunately, would have resulted in the same tragedy wherever the site of resistance may have been located. Any conclusion that the decisions of that day were racially motivated is offensive, and I will have no part of it."<sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/Move.investigation)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists have claimed that in the middle of the Iran hostage crisis, the Reagan campaign made a secret deal with the new rulers of Iran to delay the release of the hostages until after the election, dooming Carter’s chances of victory. This conspiracy theory was soundly refuted by several independent investigations. The first, a report by a Special Counsel, to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee;<sup>[[1]](https://ia800506.us.archive.org/24/items/ReportOfTheSpecialCounselOnTheOctoberSurpriseAllegationsAndTheCircumstancesSurro/Report%20of%20the%20Special%20Counsel%20on%20the%20October%20Surprise%20Allegations%20and%20the%20Circumstances%20Surrounding%20the%20Release%20of%20the%20American%20Hostages%20Held%20in%20Iran.pdf)</sup></sup> then the blockbuster report by the Joint Congressional task force. The task force reviewed more than 100,000 files from the State Department, over 5,000 pages of documents from the CIA, and several thousand pages of unredacted signals intelligence from the National Security Agency. As Historians William Inboden and Joseph Ledford point out, "Connally’s treasonous deal of the century is nowhere to be found in this highly classified material."<sup>[[2]](https://warontherocks.com/2023/04/be-skeptical-of-reagans-october-surprise/)</sup></sup> The Task Force concludes, "The central, and unifying allegation, among those the Task Force investigated was that the Iranians received arms from, or through, the Reagan Administration as a quid pro quo for delaying the release of the hostages. The Task Force investigated the specific transactions cited by the accusers, as well as the records of the various government agencies involved in maintaining and participating in all other arms transactions involving Iran in the pertinent time period. Based on this extensive review, the Task Force has concluded that there is no credible evidence linking the release of the hostages to any arms transactions with Iran. Finally, the Task Force reviewed extensive cable traffic between the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Israel, as well as the Embassy's contacts with the Israeli government, in an effort to determine whether the Reagan Administration might have secretly authorized Israel to facilitate post-release arms deals with Iran as a quid pro quo. This documentary review, combined with the sworn testimony of key Reagan and Carter administration officials, including career senior State Department officials and intelligence officers, conclusively established that the Reagan Administration upheld the arms embargo with Iran and encouraged its allies to do the same. An internal Israeli investigation conducted for the Task Force, corroborated the Task Force's findings. The Task Force concluded that arms transactions of the kind suggested by the allegations could not have occurred without many career intelligence and foreign affairs officers learning about them. Accordingly, the Task Force finds no credible evidence to support this allegation. The Task Force could find no documentation authorizing the sale of United States made arms to Iran via Israel. Rather, the Task Force determined that any arms shipped to Iran via Israel was done unilaterally by Israel or as a result of miscommunications between the United States Department of State and the Government of Israel."

  It continues, "The Task Force has found no evidence that the Reagan campaign illegally either sought or disseminated classified information. Additionally, the Task Force concluded that none of the information received or disseminated by the Reagan campaign was acquired or passed on for the overt purpose of undermining the Carter administration's handling of the hostage crisis." Further, "The allegation that Reagan Presidential campaign personnel attempted to or did delay the release of the hostages has been at the heart of the October Surprise story. The alleged agreement to delay the release was supposed to have been consummated in Paris in October 1980. The Task Force focused substantial effort on this area and finds both the components and sum of the allegation to be lacking credible evidence. In almost all instances, the evidence clearly establishes the presence of major alleged participants in Paris meetings to be someplace else, doing something else. Further, evidence which by all logic would support the existence of such meetings, such as the Hashemi FISA or Rogovin diaries, proves the contrary. The credibility of those making the allegations has in most every instance been shown to border on non-existent, while those who deny the allegations often had documentary corroboration. In sum, the Task Force found that there is simply no credible evidence of any attempt or proposal to attempt to delay the release of the Americans held hostage in Iran by the 1980 Reagan Presidential campaign."<sup>[[3]](https://li.proquest.com/elhpdf/histcontext/14148-H.rp.1102.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists allege that the CIA was behind, and covered-up for a pedo cult, known as "the Finders". However, contrary to their claims, declassified FBI records debunk this notion.<sup>[[1]](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7x53vg/the-finders-cult-from-the-80s-was-patient-zero-for-epstein-and-pizzagate-conspiracies)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://apnews.com/article/4c5cd8141e930159ea3e4f0492a41ade)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://vault.fbi.gov/the-finders)</sup></sup>

- Prior to 1980, the US Government had to choose between prosecuting cases, and sparing sources and methods. As a Congressional investigation noted, which led to the creation of CIPA, "The subcommittee discovered that enforcement of laws intended to protect national security information often requires disclosure of the very information the laws seek to protect. Indeed, the more sensitive the information compromised, the more difficult to enforce the laws that guard our national security. At times then, regardless of whether the compromise is to a newspaper reporter or directly to a foreign agent, the Government often must choose between disclosing classified information in a prosecution or letting the conduct go unpunished. In the words of one Justice Department official who testified before the subcommittee, "To what extent must we harm the national security in order to protect the national security?" Evidence of this dilemma has been found in investigations not only of leaks and espionage but also of bribery, drug trafficking and murder. Therefore, this dilemma not only adversely affects national security, but also can pervert the administration of justice." It wasn't because, "muh government coverup.<sup>[[1]](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/54608NCJRS.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On June 26, 1975, FBI Agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were executed, while injured, by Leonard Peltier at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Contrary to some media reports that gunfire lasted four hours, it lasted around 10 minutes. During this ordeal, a combined total of five rounds had been fired from both Williams’ and Coler’s weapons. The agents’ vehicles alone had 125 bullet holes. This total does not take into account those rounds that hit the agents, glass, or were not recovered. The two agents were attempting to locate and arrest Jimmy Eagle, who had an outstanding arrest warrant for assault and robbery at the reservation. Peltier himself had a an outstanding federal warrant for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution, related to his attempted murder of an off-duty police officer in Milwaukee. Contrary to Peltier's lies: In dozens of  Court and parole Commission rulings, all of them, has found him guilty: Refuting allegations of unfair trials, fabricated evidence, etc.

  The defense has alleged that the government fabricated evidence in several instances. One of those instances is the claim that the Myrtle Poor Bear affidavits were the result of undue pressure by FBI agents on Poor Bear. The government has received criticism because Poor Bear’s second and third affidavits were used in Peltier’s extradition from Canada. Poor Bear surfaced as a possible witness during the investigation. As a result, she gave three sworn affidavits. In the first affidavit, she stated she was not an eyewitness to the murders but that Peltier had told her he had committed the murders. In her second affidavit, she claimed she was an eyewitness and provided more detail concerning the incident. In the third affidavit, Poor Bear provided still more detail. Poor Bear’s second and third affidavits were used in Peltier’s extradition from Canada. To extradite, a showing of probable cause is the legal standard that is required. Peltier’s extradition was based on evidence other than Poor Bear’s affidavits. After Peltier’s extradition from Canada, subsequent interviews of Poor Bear by the government established that she was incompetent to testify at trial. As a result, Poor Bear was never called to testify at trial, and therefore, her information had nothing whatsoever to do with Peltier’s conviction. The short answer to the firearms issue is found in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decision which affirmed Peltier’s conviction the second time and states, “When all is said and done, however, a few simple but very important facts remain. The casing introduced into evidence had in fact been extracted from the Wichita AR-15. This point was not disputed.

  Accusations of government misconduct and claims that Peltier has not received fair treatment by the American justice system have continued since he was charged. A review of the legal defense afforded Peltier conclusively shows this is not the case. Normally, a federal criminal defendant is entitled to a single court-appointed attorney chosen by rotation. Peltier received five lawyers—two as trial attorneys and three as investigators. All were chosen by Peltier, rather than the normal rotation process, and all were paid for by the government. The defense received almost double the normal number of preemptory challenges during jury selection. Peltier’s lawyers were allowed to personally question the jury, which is highly unusual in federal criminal cases. The trial court provided daily transcripts of testimony to the defense, a very expensive measure which is rarely allowed. After his conviction, Peltier was allowed to dismiss four of his five trial attorneys and hire new ones for his appeals." Justice will continue to be served, as long as this heinous monster remains in prison.<sup>[[1]](https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/resmurs-case-reservation-murders)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/speeches/request-for-denial-of-parole-for-leonard-peltier)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.inforum.com/opinion/2901482-every-review-courts-has-affirmed-peltiers-guilt)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://ia600100.us.archive.org/24/items/usaond082109/usaond082109.pdf)</sup></sup>


## Human research, 1932-1990
A number of myths persist to this day, on a wide-range of Federal, State, and local government activities in human research, from WW2, to the Cold War—this is due to highly inaccurate, sensationalist headlines. Ranging from Biological, Chemical and radiation research—through the Military, CIA, and civilian institutions. Overall, the scientific consensus has been that all these experiments have been safe, in the short and long-term. Informed consent was provided in the vast majority of cases, with only a few unknowns. Nor was research conducted haphazardly, or with little regard for safety or ethics.

#### US Military 
##### BW
Between 1941 and 1969, when President Nixon banned Biological Weapons (BW), the US Army conducted a series of investigations into the defense against BW, and limited use of BW in retaliation. Open-air tests were not human research experiments, contrary to sensationalist speculation, and Soviet disinfo.

- Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson requested the National Academy of Sciences to appoint a committee to make a complete survey of the BW situation (two months prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor). After careful study, the committee concluded in February 1942 that BW was feasible and urged that appropriate steps be taken to reduce U.S. vulnerability to BW attack. Secretary Stimson then recommended to President Roosevelt the establishment of a civilian agency for this purpose. With approval by the President, the War Reserve Service (WRS) was formed in August of 1942. Scientific advice was received from a committee of prominent scientists set up by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council. The first task undertaken by WRS was the development of defensive measures against possible BW attack. Its major achievement was the organization of a research and development program (R&D now referred to in the Department of Defense as research, development, test and evaluation, (RDTE) to extend the paucity of knowledge about BW. It was concluded that significant knowledge could not be gotten without larger scale developmental operations. Therefore, in November 1942, WRS requested the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) of the Army (redesignated the Chemical Corps in 1946) to prepare to assume responsibility for a larger scale research and development program, including construction and operation of laboratories and pilot plants. 

  The Office of Strategic Services alerted the Joint Chiefs of Staff in December 1943 to indications that the Germans might be planning to use BW. The BW program was accordingly stepped up and, in June 1944, the complete program was transferred by direction of the President to the War Department. At the direction of the Secretary of War, the Chemical Warfare Service was made responsible for work on BW agents, for BW intelligence, and for BW defense. The Army Surgeon General was directed to cooperate with the CWS on matters of BW defense. The program continued as a joint effort with Navy and other Federal department participation. The R&D program was greatly accelerated with the addition of field testing facilities and a production plant. When the War Department assumed full responsibility, Secretary Stimson appointed Mr. Merck as a special consultant on BW. He also established the United States BW Committee in October 1944 wich Mr. Merck as Chairman and with senior representatives from the military services. During World War II, the policy of BW use implicity paralleled the policy for Chemical Warfare (CW); that is, retaliation only. While the United States had not ratified the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925 which prohibited CW and BW, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill announced this policy in unilateral statements in the spring of 1942. By the end of World War II, a wide variety of disease agents effective against man, animals, and plants had been studied and limited field testing conducted. Extensive work on safety measures to perform BW research and development had been necessary as no comprehensive procedures, methodologies or equipment had been available at the start. Even so, infections occurred. These were later reported publicly in the extensive War Department press release on BW in January 1946. The release was the first notification to the nation and the world of United States work in BW. It reported, in part, that:  "In all work on biological warfare carried on in the United States, extreme care was taken to protect the participating personnel from infection. Many new techniques were devised to prevent infection and proved highly successful. Hospitals and dispensaries were maintained at all installations, staffed with both Army and Navy personnel and were equipped to treat accidental infections. As the result of the extraordinary precautions taken, there occurred only sixty cases of proven infection caused by accidental exposure to virulent biological warfare agents which required treatment. Fifty-two of these recovered completely; of the eight cases remaining, all are recovering satisfactorily. There were, in addition to the sixty proven cases, 159 accidental exposures to agents of unknown concentrations. All but one of these received prompt treatment and did not develop any infection. In one instance, the individual did not report exposure, developed the disease, but recovered after treatment."

  In response to concerns about the vulnerability of the United States to covert attack, the Research and Development Board, OSD, requested its Committee on BW to consider the implications of BW in sabotage in extension of a study by a Special "Ad Hoc Panel on Sabotage." In October 1948, the Committee submitted a "Report on Special BW Operations" concluding that: BW was well adapted to subversive use; U.S. was particularly susceptible to attack by BW operations which presented a grave danger, and the current BW R&D program did not meet the requirements to defend against subversive BW operations. The Committee provided a blueprint on goals, objectives, organization, and examples of projects. One of their defensive project examples was conduct of vulnerability tests on "...test ventilating systems, subway systems, and water supply systems with innocuous organisms..." Their recommendations were subsequently approved and became the genesis of open air vulnerability tests and covert R&D programs conducted by the Army, some of which were in support of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As a result of the study recommendation a Special Operations (SO) Division was established at Camp Detrick, MD in May 1949. At the end of World War II, all the field test sites with the exception of Dugway Proving Ground, were abandoned and the primitive Granite Peak BW test site at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah was inactivated. Pathogenic agent testing at Camp Detrick was confined to closed laboratory size chambers and was directly related to agent evaluation and medical defensive aspects. In this period, no control experimentation on humans had yet been conducted at Camp Detrick even though such experimentation was an acceptable practice in the development of vaccines within the U.S. medical community.

  Small scale outdoor testing with two biological simulants (BG, a spore forming microorganism; Serratia marcescens, a vegetative organism commonly referred to as SM) and inert material such as talc, were conducted at Camp Detrick. These materials were considered to be totally harmless by scientific and medical experts. In 1949, construction of an enclosed one million liter test sphere (the largest in the world) was built at Fort Detrick and BW explosive munition tests with pathogens were started. The first open air sea tests with biological simulants were conducted in 1950 aboard U.S. naval ships in the Atlantic Ocean off Norfolk, VA. Simulant clouds were released to envelop ships so as to assess their vulnerability and to test prototype BW electronic detection devices. These same stimulants were released in open-air tests in San Francisco, Panama City, Key West, New York subway, Washington, D.C. Pennsylvania, Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, Port Hueneme, USS Coral, and San Clemente. These occurred under various project/operation names, such as LAC, top hat, SHAD, project 112, whitecoat, Sea-Spray, Dew, D-22 program, etc.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/us-army-bw-activity)</sup></sup>

  "Operation Whitecoat" was the code name for the plan to use human volunteers in field experiments concerning the effects of certain biological pathogens upon humans. Thorough legal investigation and ethical review yielded a group of conditions under which volunteers could be used in research: Voluntary consent is required. Written consent must be witnessed, and signed by the individual concerned. No experimentation which could predictably lead to death or permanent disabling injury will be investigated with the use of human volunteers. Proper medical supervision and treatment capability will be immediately available to the subjects. Experimentation must be expected to yield fruitful results for the good of society, not available by other means. Experimentation should avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering. The degree of risk taken should never exceed the importance of the experiment or the expectable benefits from it. The volunteer may remove himself from the experiment at any stage if he feels that he has reached the limits of his physical or mental endurance. The above elements were incorporated in the policies and procedures for the use of human volunteers in biological warfare research published by the Army Chief of Staff (CS 385-30, June 1952). Assignment to Fort Detrick did not mean that the volunteer automatically participated in human experimentation. There was a distinct process used for each experiment. Each medical investigator prepared a protocol that was extensively reviewed and modified to comply with the twelve ethical principles of the Nuremberg Code. (The Nuremberg war crimes trials convicted 23 Nazi doctors of murder). In 1946, Andrew Ivey released his list of ten conditions required for "permissible medical experiments" in healthy subjects, which became known as the Nuremberg Code. These twelve conditions are embodied in the Wilson Memorandum described above.) When a review validated the ethical requirement and scientific validity of an experiment, it was forwarded to Army officials for approval. It was at this point that potential volunteers were briefed as a group on the approved protocol. During this briefing, they became familiar with the purpose of the study and the risks and benefits involved. They also attended an interview with a scientist where they could ask questions about the research. Volunteers were encouraged to discuss the study with family members, clergy and personal physicians. After an obligatory waiting period of 24 hours to four weeks (the length depended on the presumed risks of the study), informed consent documents would be signed. It must be stressed that Operation Whitecoat soldiers were not required to participate in any study, only to be present for the protocol briefings by principal investigators seeking volunteers. About 20 percent of Operation Whitecoat volunteers did not participate in any study during their tenure at Fort Detrick.<sup>[[2]](https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Frequently-Asked-Questions/Human-Subject-Research-at-Fort-Detrick)</sup></sup>

  Several news papers claimed there had been death or serious illness in San Francisco, even a study claimed there might have been a link at a SF and Stanford hospitals. However, close scrutiny of that paper shows serious flaws. Indeed, a seperate review by a group of eminent scientists to review the available information and provide recommendations on the future use of SM. The four reviewers were from CDC, USPHS; Department of Health, City of New York, Ohio State University; and Microbiological Institutes, National Institutes of Health, USPHS. "The data in the referenced article describing the experience in San Francisco are incomplete as to the primary relation of the SM isolated from the patients and their illnesses, except in the case of one patient who died from bacterial endocarditis and SM bacteremia. With this single exception, the finding of SM in these cases was not shown to have influenced the clinical course of the patients' illnesses." 

  Health data for Monroe County (Key West) and Bay County (Panama City) do not support the Newsday allegations of pneumonia cases according to Dr. C. Prather, Florida's Health Officer, as given to the National Observer Weekend Edition (26 December 1976). A state-wide influenza epidemic hit Florida in 1952 and 1953 with a corresponding increase in pneumonia. According to Dr. Prather, the incidence of pneumonia in Bay County (Panama City) was relatively constant in 1951, 1952, and 1953. Additionally, SM has been used medically as a bacterial tracer from 1937 to 1969 with the results having been published in highly reputable medical journals as late as February 1969. Dr. David J. Sencer, Assistant Surgeon General, Center for Division Control in Atlanta GA provides additional data regarding the incidence of pneumonia and influenza deaths near cities where the vulnerability tests were conducted. The report substantiates the lack of evidence associating the reported deaths with the organisms used in the various tests.<sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/us-army-bw-activity/page/141/mode/2up)</sup></sup>

##### CW
- Chemical releases, (Fluorescent particles, ZnCdS), in the public domain, such as St Louis, Minneapolis. Despite claims made by Lisa Martino-Taylor in her dissertation—a critical examination of declassified documents she cites, reveals no evidence of a hidden program of radioactive tests in St. Louis and Minneapolis. Nor do they reveal any coverup or secrecy or "poisoned" residents, between 1953 and 1965. To quote from the material she references, "Meetings were held with various city officials of St. Louis for the purpose of completing arrangements for wiresonde and field-test operations. Minor difficulties with the Park Commissioner were ironed out with the completion of the change in city administration. The St. Louis police department was quite cooperative at all times, and the fire department aided in the recovery of a kytoon and thermistor which had become entangled in a tree during gusty winds. Civil Defence and city officials of Winnipeg and surrounding municipalities were exceptionally cooperative in helping to initiate mesometeorological operations in that city. As a result, considerable interest was shown by the press and the public. Nor did these studies target minorities. Indeed, the opposite is true, "Those residents in the How Area contacted for location of sampling equipment in homes were found to be extremely cooperative."<sup>[[4]](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0031508.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://archive.org/details/Aerosol-study)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://archive.org/details/st-louis-dispersion-study)</sup></sup> The aerosols that were released were all safe. The US Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventative Medicine conducted health risk assessments of these Cold War era tests in 1994 following the declassification of the test reports. These health risk assessments used guidance from the EPA and focused on determining the health effects from inhalation exposure to the ZnCdS, which was used to simulate potential Soviet deployed biological agents from that era. These health risk assessments determined that exposure to ZnCds from the testing would not cause a health risk to those exposed. The National Research Council Committee on Toxicology, a private nonprofit institution, conducted an independent review of the health risk assessments. In their report, Completed in 1997, the NRC agreed with the Army's conclusion that ZnCdS exposures would not cause a health risk, finding, "tests did not expose residents of the United States and Canada to chemical levels considered harmful."<sup>[[7]](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/5739/toxicologic-assessment-of-the-armys-zinc-cadmium-sulfide-dispersion-tests)</sup></sup> In addition, they recommended that the Army conduct a subsequent toxicological study to determine the effects of ZnCds when it broke down in the body.

  The U.S. Army followed the National Research Council's recommendations and completed a toxicological study in 1998. The toxicological study found that more than 40% of the ZnCdS was cleared from the test subjects within the first day, only a very small amount was found after one week, and the remaining amount was negligible after 14 weeks following exposure. Additionally, it found evidence that ZnCdS does not likely break down into Cadmium in the body. While a single very high concentration could elicit an inflammatory response in the lungs that diminished with time, this dosage was 8,409 times the amount that was used in the Army ZnCdS dispersion testing. This study was peer reviewed and published in Inhalation Toxicology, Volume 12 in 2000.

  The National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine conducted an independent review of the toxicity study in 2004 and corroborated the conclusions presented in the National Research Council assessment and the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine toxicological study. The U.S. Army Public Health Command has reviewed the health risk assessments as well as available source documents from the NRC's Committee on Toxicology and the Institute of Medicine. The U.S. Army Public Health Command reconfirms that exposure to ZCdS, under the test conditions reported, would not cause a health risk in humans. Further, these reports contain no evidence of a radioactive component to the ZnCdS dispersion testing as has been alleged in the media.<sup>[[8]](https://web.archive.org/web/20121109112920/http://www.blunt.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/430b5197-ca1d-4b06-bcc5-c8d7f9d7cf92/Response%20from%20Army.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  Indeed, several independent studies were conducted by the UK's Academy of Medical Sciences, and others, finding that ZnCdS, CdS and Cd is also safe—as these were also used by the MoD's dispersion tests, (Dorset Biological Warfare Experiments, also known as DICE trials) "With regard to the land-based trials it is concluded that the dissemination of ZnCdS by the UK during the ‘Cold War’ did not significantly add to the cadmium concentrations in soil, except within a few metres of the point of dissemination of the material. Except immediately around the dispersal sites in two trials at RAF Beaulieu airfield, the predicted soil concentrations are within the range of cadmium concentrations normally observed in the UK and much lower than those found at Shipham. Risk to the public from soil contamination with cadmium from these and other ZnCdS dispersion trials is therefore considered to be negligible. With regard to the long-range contamination trials, the dose potentially received by inhalation during even the most severe case was small (c. 0.13 μg Cd). Over all the trials, our worst case estimate of personal dose received from these trials is c. 10 μg over an eight year period. This is the amount of cadmium that is inhaled in a normal urban environment in a period of between 12 and 100 days (or from smoking a total of 100 cigarettes). We are also reassured by the fact that no increased incidence has been claimed for the diseases that are particularly associated with cadmium toxicity. We were further reassured by discovering that the people largely involved in the dissemination of the cadmium sulphide from aircraft who will have been exposed to very much larger amounts than anybody on the ground suffered no ill effects. Our conclusions therefore do mirror those in the much more comprehensive American study."<sup>[[9]](https://acmedsci.ac.uk/file-download/34958-ZincCadm.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://oem.bmj.com/content/59/1/13)</sup></sup> <sup>[[11]](https://archive.org/details/uk-bw-defence-field-trials-1940-1979)</sup></sup>
  
- Volunteers. The preliminary Laboratory research was absolutely necessary in order to insure compliance with the basic policy governing the use of humans in research, Chief of Staff Memorandum 385, which provided: "The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature. The number of volunteers wed shall be kept at a minimum. The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experiments and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated research will justify the performance of the experiment. The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury. No experiment should be conducted where there is a prior reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur. The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian Importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment. Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment. In order to be in full compliance with the Department of the Army regulations and policies, scientists were involved in a great deal of painstaking research long before volunteers were used. The preliminary work often took years.

  There were several ways that chemical compounds came to the attention of the Medical Research Laboratories. Some of those were: discovery by Medical Laboratory employees through basic research or during experiments with other chemicals; review of professional literature; accidental or intentional discovery by industry; and recommendations from other medical research institutions (both in the US and other countries). However, the most prevalent source of chemical compounds appeared to be from the Chemical Corps Industrial Liaison Program. An example of this method was the discovery of benzilates (BZ), the most useful of the known incapacitating agents developed by the Chemical Corps. It was reported that as of October 1960 that the most potent benzilate candidate agent under consideration by the Chemical Corps was agent EA 2277. Chemical Corps screened this compound, along with thousands of others recived from their various sources, to determine its potential military usefullnes. Once the compounds with military value were selected from the mass of candidate agents, more detailed studies begin. These studies were known as "initial toxicity screening." Between 1950-1975 approximately 34,500 compounds were studied. Following initial screening, each compound was reviewed in light of its potential military value. Records reflected that 2,077 agents survived the initial review. Those agents selected for further chemical analysis were divided into three general categories: proposed irritants; incapacitants (such as LSD, PCP); and lethal agents.

  The proposed incapacitating agents were next studied in animal behavior tests, using several different species (still in the chemical laboratories). Next, the candidate agents were presented to the Medical Research Laboratories for adaptational research. Initial medical research included an evaluation of the data available from the Chemical Laboratory, evidence from industry, private institutions, and technical literature. Additionally, the laboratory staff conducted pathology and pharmacology studies. Following these evaluations, a second major review was conducted to further reduce the number of candidate compounds. Records reflected that 2,026 of the available 2,077 agents were rejected at this stage of the research cycle. The remaining 51 candidate agents were submitted for pre-clinical testing at the Medical Research Laboratories. The next laboratory studies involved research in numerous animal species, prophylaxis studies, and therapy studies. Only 32 candidate agents reportedly survived the pre-clinical research phase of the cycle. Those agents were selected for clinical testing with volunteers. Once the agent passed the pre-clinical or animal testing phase it was considered safe for human experiments.

  A request to conduct experiments with nerve gases on volunteers was submitted in August 1953. Permission was granted in November 1953, however, it did not provide for a source of volunteer subjects. On 12 March 1954 The Surgeon General prepared a set of principles, policies, and rules for the use of human volunteers in medical research. With four exceptions, these principles generally were the same as those published in Chief of Staff memorandum 385. The first rule was in the form of expanded guidance regarding volunteer consent. Next, rules 7 and 8 of the Chief of Staff memorandum 358 guidance were expanded as follows: "Adequate preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death. This included hospitalization and medical treatment as may be required. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons (including an adequately trained physician) who shall be required to exercise the highest degree of skill and care throughout the experiment. Competent consultants should be available on short notice in this connection." Finally, there was included an additional rule: "Agents used in research must have the following limiting characteristics: controllable lethality; no serious chronicity anticipated; effective therapy available; and adequate background or animal experimentations." These were not intended to replace the rules set forth in the basic policy, but rather to clarify their intent. This program reportedly visualized four types of studies for human volunteers. "The first category consists of planned, hazardous experiments where there is a clear-cut risk, but with intelligent, adequate supervision, safeguards, and adequate therapy available, it is felt that no irrevocable damage will be done. Experiments will not be attempted where such damage can be foreseen. These form the type of experiments for which the Army Secretary's approval has been received and the only kind where such approval is required. Another category includes risk of accidental exposure to hazardous degree. The fullest possible studies should be made of any such unplanned exposures. The third category consists of experiments that are only potentially but not definitely hazardous. These experiments would be hazardous if the individual, despite previous examinations and check-up, should prove unusually senstitive, or if there occurs an accidental error or break in technique. The fourth category of procedures will be those designated non-hazardous, experiments involving no hazard greater than that of crossing a highway."
  
  Pennsylvania’s Holmesburg prison. An investigation found that Dr. Albert Kligman complied with DoD policy on human volunteers that required, among other things, consent. It was also the only experiment conducted on inmates.<sup>[[12]](https://archive.org/details/army-igchem)</sup></sup> Another review found, "It appears that all of the test subjects were volunteers and that stringent medical safeguards and followup procedures were used."<sup>[[13]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/NCB/02-A-0846_RELEASE.pdf#page=5)</sup></sup>

  Evidence that more than 7,000 volunteers were tested at Edgewood Arsenal without a single fatality or serious injury must be accepted as supporting evidence of the ability of the US Army and the medical research staff to fulfill their responsibilities.<sup>[[14]](https://archive.org/details/army-igchem)</sup></sup> In the spring of 1980, the Department of the Army asked the Committee on Toxicology of the National Research Council's Board on Toxicology and Environmental Health Hazards to study the possible chronic or delayed adverse health effects incurred by servicemen who had been exposed experimentally to various chemicals at the U.S. Army Laboratories, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Edgewood, Maryland, during 1955-1975. Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a three-volume study, which found no adverse health effects from those subjects.<sup>[[15]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222994/)</sup></sup> Project SHAD was under Project 112. They ran both chemical and biological tests. To date, there is no clear evidence of specific, long-term health problems associated with participation in Project SHAD. The Health and Medicine Division (formally known as the Institute of Medicine) of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducted a study sponsored by VA and presented findings in the 2007 report Long-Term Health Effects of Participation in Project SHAD (Shipboard Hazard and Defense). The same conclusions were found in a 2016 Report, Assessing Health Outcomes Among Veterans of Project SHAD (Shipboard Hazard and Defense).<sup>[[16]](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11900/long-term-health-effects-of-participation-in-project-shad-shipboard-hazard-and-defense)</sup></sup> <sup>[[17]](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21846/assessing-health-outcomes-among-veterans-of-project-shad-shipboard-hazard-and-defense)</sup></sup> <sup>[[18]](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/shad/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[[19]](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/edgewood-aberdeen/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[[20]](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/shad/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[[21]](https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Environmental-Exposures/Chemical-and-Biological-Exposures)</sup></sup>
  
- Among the first chemicals used as lethal/tactical weapons during World War I (WW I) were vesicants or blistering agents. The most widely used agents were the mustards, also known as mustard gas. Fearful that mustard gas might be used again in WW II, the U.S. military conducted experiments at the beginning of the war to test the effectiveness of various protective clothing and equipment in preventing injury/incapacitation due to mustard gas exposure (2). One method of testing involved exposing Navy volunteers wearing protective clothing and gas masks to mustard gas in a sealed chamber that was 10′ by 15′ with a 12′ high ceiling. The interiors of the chambers were most often maintained at 90°F and 65% relative humidity to test the durability of protective clothing under tropical conditions. Chamber test participants were often ask to perform routine duties, (e.g., marching), to determine the degree they had been incapacitated by their exposure to mustard gas. 
  
  A study published in 2000, at the recommendation of NRC, found, "To date there have been no studies examining possible long-term adverse health effects among test participants who received low level non-lethal exposures of mustard gas. We conducted a mortality follow-up study comparing the cause specific mortality of exposed veterans (i.e., veterans who participated in chamber tests) to that of controls (i.e., veterans who served during the same time period but who had no evidence of mustard gas exposure). All veterans in this study were white males. This study assessed the risk of cause-specific mortality associated with mustard gas exposure among Navy chamber test participants. Assessing the relative risk of cause specific mortality, namely respiratory diseases and respiratory cancers, there was no increased risk of any cause of death associated with mustard gas exposure. There was also no increased risk in cause specific mortality associate with level of mustard gas exposure among exposed veterans."<sup>[[22]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1047279700000600)</sup></sup>

##### Radiation
- After WW2, the United States DoD conducted experiments with radiation on human subjects. An independent review that examined studies and policy from 1944 to 1994 found: Fully informed consent was an essential requirement for human subjects, as well as adequate medical treatment and strict ethics guidance adhered to.

  For example, conspiracy theorists have claimed that the DoD and University of Cincinnati conducted unethical experiments "on more than 90 poor, black, advanced stage cancer patients with inoperable tumors" and that Dr. Eugene Saenger "forged consent forms, and did not inform the patients of the risks of irradiation." However, this couldn't be further from the truth. The research at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine (UCCM) examined the effectiveness of using new, deep-penetrating TBI technology to improve the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. During the 1950s and 1960s, the DoD sought information on the biological and clinical features of radiation injury. The DoD funded laboratory studies and psychological tests of cancer patients after they had received TBI and PBI as treatment for their disease. The DoD’s initial objective was to obtain a biological marker of radiation exposure. After 1965, the DoD was also interested in obtaining data on the psychological response to radiation exposure. A total of 88 patients from Cincinnati General Hospital participated in this project. Patient selection criteria required that only individuals with proven metastatic or far-advanced cancer be selected for the studies. In addition, subjects had to be in relatively good nutritional status and, in most cases, have normal hematologic values. These criteria remained relatively constant throughout the twelve years of the study. UCCM researchers also sought patients who had not undergone previous radiation or chemotherapy, had normal kidney function and new, abnormal tissue growth that was not radiosensitive, and were without lymphoma or bronchogenic cancer. According to a 1972 University of Cincinnati review of the project, the demographic distribution of study participants reflected the patient population of the Cincinnati General Hospital.
  
  UCCM researchers determined that TBI and PBI therapies were effective in controlling certain advanced cancers. They reported that the relief effects of radiation treatments compared favorably with results using anticancer drugs or chemotherapy. Delivery of higher radiation doses caused patients to experience blood problems, which included loss of red and white blood cells and platelets. Doctors infused bone marrow early in the post-irradiation period, hoping to prevent these problems. In May 1963, researchers in this project proposed establishing facilities for the withdrawal, storage, and reinfusion of bone marrow. By April 1966, a filtration system for the reinfusion of human bone marrow was completed, and by April 1969, success in bone marrow reinfusion was achieved. The use of this process immediately after radiation therapy minimized the characteristic bone marrow depression associated with higher doses of radiation. The degree of illness following reinfusion was significantly decreased and hospitalization greatly shortened. 
  
  Psychological studies of the patients in the UCCM project began in 1965. The DoD’s objective was to determine the effect of radiation exposure on emotional and intellectual functioning. The tests were designed to take into account the many complex variables that may influence the measurement of these functions after radiation treatment. The tests included the Reitan Trials Test, Cattell’s 16 Personality Factor Test, Wechsler Depression Rating Scale, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and the five-minute verbal content test of Gottschalk and Gleser. The researchers found evidence of a decrease in intellectual functioning immediately after radiation. This effect was temporary, and functioning improved markedly within three days.

  In January 1972, the American College of Radiology (ACR) reviewed the science, methodology, and design of the project from a medical point of view to determine if the project conformed to then-contemporary standards for clinical investigations. The ACR report concluded that the UCCM project was validly conceived, stated, executed, controlled, and followed up; the process of patient selection conformed with sound medical practice; and procedures for obtaining patient consent were valid, thorough, and consistent with National Institutes of Health recommendations and the practices of most cancer centers. Also in November 1971, Clifford Grulee, M.D., Dean of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, appointed an Ad Hoc Committee made up of members of the UCCM faculty to review the project. Dr. Grulee asked the committee to review the project’s scientific content, methodology, and data treatment. The committee’s report, released in January 1972, indicated that there were no problems with the project’s scientific content or methodology. In addition, the committee stated that there was no evidence that DASA funding was made contingent on work, ideas, or suggestions proposed by DASA and all information reported to DASA was kept unclassified and publicly available.<sup>[[23]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210821164345/https://archive.defense.gov/pubs/dodhre/Narratv.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  From 1963 to 1973, a leading endocrinologist, Dr. Carl Heller, studied radiation's affects male reproductive function. ACHRE, "in its own analysis of the risks incurred by the Oregon and Washington testicular irradiation subjects based on a 600-rem dose, which was the maximum testicular exposure of any subject in either state. For purposes of this analysis we assumed that the testicles have average radiation sensitivity; that there is a linear relationship between cancer incidence and dose, and that there is a linear relationship between the risk of cancer and the amount of tissue exposed. Using these assumptions, we calculated that it would take more than double the dose received by any prisoner-subject to yield an effective dose of 1 rem. This means that the predicted increase over the expected cancer rate for the individuals who received the greatest exposure would be less that four-hundreths of 1 percent. For those who received smaller doses of radiation, the risk would, of course, be smaller, too.<sup>[[24]](https://ehss.energy.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap9_2.html)</sup></sup>
  
- Some conspiracy theorists cite, what they believe as evidence, that the government covered-up evidence of the dangers posed to communities while conducting nuclear tests, in general—is a August 1980 subcommittee report on low-level radiation exposure. They quote the passage, "In addition, the government's program for monitoring the health effects of the tests was in-adequate and, more disturbingly all evidence suggesting that radiation was having harmful effects, be it on the sheep or the people, was not only disregarded but actually suppressed." However, a careful reading of this report shows that the only item they believe was "covered-up" and "suppressed" was a specific incident involving the deaths of sheep in Utah and Nevada. This incident only related to the Upshot-Knothole Test Series. A critical reading doesn't support the subcommittee's report. The matter was settled by a consensus in scientific literature, and also in Court, in 1956. The judge presiding over the case was A. Sherman Christensen. The government’s defense (backed by expert witnesses and unclassified records) maintained that fallout levels from the Upshot-Knothole Test Series were too low to cause the sheep deaths, and that the timing between the atomic tests and subsequent sheep deaths was purely a coincidence. Judge Christensen sided with the expert testimony provided by the AEC, stating that the government was negligent in not warning sheep owners of potential fallout in the area, but nothing more. A few years later, he overturned this ruling based on the aforementioned report. However, this ruling was in turn, over-ruled by a 3-Judge panel. "The trial court thus (1) mentioned the Bustad report and asserted that information had been withheld; (2) it mentioned that the Government had given misleading information as to radiation dosages; (3) that the veterinarians had been pressured by the Government; and (4) that misleading answers had been given to interrogatories by the Government. Each of these specifics have been considered in relation to the record in the proceedings appealed from and to what original record and briefs are extant. We must conclude that none of these several findings or conclusions are supported by the record. The information, data, reports, maps, experiments and witnesses were all available to plaintiffs at the first trial. The data is the same now. They tried their case on the basis of their then best judgment in the selection of witnesses, interviews, the evaluation of data and reports, and the consideration of the position of the experts.

  We have not mentioned the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory comparative study of radiation burns (in experiments) and the lesions on the Utah sheep. The analysis of tissues, organs, bones and blood samples made by Doctors Comar, Rust and Trum showed no evidence of radiation injury to the sheep in the flocks of plaintiffs where the losses took place. A tissue analysis was made on the sheep by the Utah University College of Medicine and the conclusion was reached that the sheep had been exposed to radiation but the examination concluded that there had been no acute effects from the exposure. The Hanford comparative study, as mentioned, concluded that the sheep had not died from exposure to radiation. In Bulloch I the conclusion of the experts was that the sheep and lambs had died as a result of unprecedented cold weather during the lambing and shearing, together with malnutrition, also to generally poor range conditions and to common diseases which caused the skin lesions and deaths. These conditions were established by the evidence. The losses began after an initial detonation but before the detonation of the "Harry" test. The expert witnesses who were the leading authorities on the subject thus concluded that the losses were not due to radiation. There was no evidence presented that humans in the areas with the sheep nor animals such as the sheep dogs or horses, which were with the sheep, were affected. This recent increase in the heat, the light, and awareness of atomic energy is all worthwhile, but we are unable to find in it any reason, as the plaintiffs apparently would have us do, to overturn the considered judgment of the court reached 25 years ago.<sup>[[25]](https://casetext.com/case/bulloch-v-united-states-2)</sup></sup> <sup>[[26]](https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1201913/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[27]](http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat4/150521.pdf)</sup> <sup>[[28]](https://www.energy.gov/management/articles/fehner-and-gosling-atmospheric-nuclear-weapons-testing-1951-1963-battlefield)</sup></sup> A seperate lawsuit rested in 1988, where it was alleged that the Government failed in a duty to warn and provide information. A Federal appeals Court found this not so—while smacking down other claims. "In the instant case, no evidence was presented of any act or omission of the AEC or its employees that clearly contravened a specific statutory or regulatory duty, or that exceeded statutory or regulatory authority. There was no evidence, for example, that the Test Information Officer failed to release information he was required to give out, or that the Radsafe Officer failed to take a specific radiation measurement that had been decided upon."<sup>[[29]](https://casetext.com/case/allen-v-us-59?q=Allen%20v.%20U.S.,%20No.%2084-2126&sort=relevance&p=1&type=case)</sup></sup>
  
- In 1954, the US detonated a series of nuclear bombs to study their yield. This was part of Operation Castle and Operation Crossroads, near Bikini Atoll. Due to a miscalculation there was an increase in radiation output than expected. The US Department of Energy estimated that 253 inhabitants of the Marshall Islands were impacted by the radioactive fallout. It is alleged that the US deliberately used the Marshallese as "ginea pigs" for testing radiation under project 4.1. This allegation has been thoroughly investigated and is not supported by any evidence. Operation Castle had no biomedical program. US Military personnel were also exposed to large amounts of radiation, when they thought they were in safe areas of the expected yield.<sup>[[30]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16380885-g1vuWf/16380885.pdf#page=212)</sup></sup> <sup>[[31]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16061854-leUIeE/16061854.pdf#page=5)</sup></sup>

- Operation Plumbbob. Troops were not studied for radiation research, contrary to conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists.
Exercises Desert Rock VII and VIII, the test groups, and AFSWC each developed its own organization and procedures for ensuring the radiological safety of its members based on the established criteria of the AEC. The radiological safety plans were developed to minimize operational exposures to ionizing radiation. The safety of Desert Rock VII and VIII participants was the responsibility of the Desert Rock Exercise Director. A maximum radiation exposure limit of 5.0 Roentgens (R) in any 6-month period was established for Desert Rock troops. Of this exposure, no more than 2.0 R was to be from prompt radiation. Exposure limits for blast pressure and thermal radiation were also established. Based on exposure limits and mode of delivery, minimum distance criteria for positioning Desert Rock troops and observers were established. For a tower shot with a predicted maximum yield of about 10 kilotons, troops in the open were positioned at least 4,000 yards from ground zero. Troops in trenches at such a shot were positioned no closer than 2,600 yards from ground zero. Troops in armored vehicles were positioned no closer than 2,800 yards from ground zero. Radiation doses have been reconstructed for all of the major troop test units at the operation. These doses are in agreement with the available film badge dosimetry. About 40 DOD personnel received total doses exceeding 5 rem∗ during PLUMBBOB; half of these were accrued by cloud samplers or penetrators. The three largest doses were between 13 and 22 rem to Air Force fliers who penetrated the Shot JOHN cloud at about 10 minutes after burst. The other doses over 5 rem were scattered, mostly among Desert Rock VII and VIII support and technical service project personnel. Very few of the personnel in the major troop test described above received as much as 2 rem. The average total dose to DOD participants at PLUMBBOB was 0.4 rem. Animals were used for medical examination.<sup>[[32]](https://www.dtra.mil/Portals/125/Documents/NTPR/newDocs/14-PLUMBBOB%20-%202021.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[33]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16004390.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[34]](https://www.dtra.mil/Portals/125/Documents/NTPR/newDocs/ANTHReport/1957_DNA_6005F.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[35]](https://ia801305.us.archive.org/17/items/Misc-DoD/Analysis%20of%20Radiation%20Exposure%204th%20Marine%20Corps%20Provisional%20Atomic%20Exercise%20Brigade%2015%20June%201981.pdf)</sup></sup>

  As the ACHRE and DoD reviews found, "no documentation has been identified to indicate that human radiation experiments were part of the U.S. atmospheric nuclear weapons testing program. The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) concluded in 1995 that, 'although there was a real possibility that human subject research had been conducted in conjunction with the bomb tests, the tests were not themselves experiments involving human subjects.' Human aspects research conducted in conjunction with atomic weapons tests was designed to study the effects atomic weapons would have on combat operations. For example, flashblindness studies, troop training and maneuvers, psychological testing, and decontamination studies were designed with the goal of increasing the capabilities and preparedness of military forces to conduct effective military operations on a nuclear battlefield."<sup>[[36]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210821164345/https://archive.defense.gov/pubs/dodhre/Narratv.pdf)</sup></sup> Lastly, it should be noted that the Advisory Committee did find that "for the period 1944 to 1974 there is no evidence that any [US] government statement or policy on research involving human subjects contained a provision permitting a waiver of consent requirements for national security reasons".
  
- Green Run. ACHRE and the GAO found that, "Our work did not document that the test was intended to be a radiation warfare experiment or a field test of radiobiological effects on humans. In particular, we examined still-classified passages in the Green Run test report and found that they did not refer to any such intentions or operations."<sup>[[37]](http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat4/150521.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[38]](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10111991)</sup></sup>  

#### CIA
##### MKULTRA
- There exists a rich universe of misleading allegations of MKULTRA, due to pop culture, historical revisionists and disinformation agents, about MKULTRA. Here are the raw facts:

  CIA has had a recurring interest in behavioral drugs. The subject is of general interest because of the operational applications that could be made against Agency employees by hostile forces, for which there would be a defensive requirement, as well as for possible use against foreigners to influence their behavior. The earliest record of this interest dates to the post-WWII period when there were indications of Soviet interest in the use of drugs for such purposes, the most famous example being the bizarre confessions of Cardinal Mindszenty in February 1949. In the past, CIA's interest has taken form in 4 programs: Bluebird/artichoke, mkdelta/search.

  BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE: In 1949 the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI) undertook the analysis of foreign work on certain unconventional warfare techniques, including behavioral drugs, with an initial objective of developing a capability to resist or offset the effect of behavioral drugs. There also was extensive review of foreign literature, particularly work in the Soviet Bloc. This program shortly became Project BLUEBIRD, with the objectives of (a) discovering means of conditioning personnel to prevent unauthorized extraction of information from them by known means, (b) investigating the possibility of obtaining control of an individual by application of special interrogation techniques, (c) memory enhancement, and (d) establishing defensive means for preventing hostile control of Agency personnel. In August 1951 Project bluebird was renamed Project artichoke which, in 1952, was transferred from OSI to the predecessor organization of the Office of Security. OSI did retain a responsibility for evaluation of foreign intelligence aspects of the matter and in 1953 made a proposal that experiments be made in testing LSD with Agency volunteers; OSI records indicate that no such experiments were made. OSI's involvement in this project was terminated in 1956. Meanwhile, the emphasis given artichoke in the predecessor organization to the Office of Security became that of use of materials such as sodium pentothal in connection with interrogation techniques and with the polygraph. During this period there was an informal Agency group known as the artichoke Committee, with representation from the Offices of Scientific Intelligence (OSI) and Medical Services (OMS), and the predecessor organizations of the Offices of Security and Technical Services (OTS). There are no records indicating the details of the exchanges in this committee, although there are references in fragmentary records of continued interest in LSD. The predecessor organization of the Office of Technical Service also was interested in behavioral drugs, although none of the office's records on this activity are in existence, having been destroyed in January 1973. As noted above it participated in the meetings of the so-called artichoke Committee. That office maintained liaison with personnel at Camp Dietrick, with whom meetings were held once or twice a year to discuss questions involving behavorial drugs. At one such meeting at Deep Creek Lake in Maryland, 18-19 November 1953, with seven representatives from Camp Dietrick and three from CIA, eight of those present were administered LSD which had been introduced into a bottle of Cointreau. 

  Although records of an inquiry by the Inspector General into the incident indicate that those present discussed testing on unwitting persons, and agreed in principle that such a program should be explored, none of them were advised until some 20 minutes after they drank the Cointreau that it had been treated with LSD. Of the two who did not take it, one did not drink alcoholic beverages at all and the other refrained because of a heart condition. One of the members of the group, a civilian employee of the Department of Army named Frank R. Olson, had serious after-effects. He was sent at CIA expense, with an escort from CIA, to New York where he received treatment from a psychiatrist, commencing 24 November. While in New York for this treatment he threw himself through a closed window in his room on the 10th floor of the Statler Hotel, falling to his death. CIA, in a document of 9 December 1953, signed by its General Counsel, certified that Dr. Olson's death resulted from "circumstances arising out of an experiment undertaken in the course of his official duties for the United States Government." This was the official position of the Agency, established for the purpose of assuring that the survivors of Dr. Olson received compensation from the BEC. Dr. Olson had experienced some instability and delusions prior to the incident, and it was judged that the drug served to trigger the act leading to his death. Official reprimands were issued by the DCI to three CIA employees held responsible for the incident.

  MKDELTA/SEARCH: On 29 October 1952 a formal policy was established by the Deputy Director of Plans (as then styled, now Deputy Director for Operations) for the use of biochemicals in clandestine operations (mkdelta). This was brought under a special funding procedure established on 3 April 1953 for special research purposes (mkultra). Among the materials studied were psylocbin and LSD. Following laboratory testing a second phase was begun which involved testing on voluntary participants. This research was conducted at well-known institutions under the control and direction of researchers at, and in conformance to the standards of, those institutions. The research and its results were generally unclassified and published in the normal manner by those researchers.  In only three instances was research performed in a manner which would raise questions regarding its ethical/moral propriety (the safehouse activities, with the Bureau of Narcotics as the lead) The questionable subprojects involved the use of individuals who were not aware that they were the subjects of a research program or that they were being given a drug. This unwitting testing generally took place in social situations among friends and acquaintances of the researcher.  In 1963, after questions were raised within the Agency by the Inspector General about the propriety of these subprojects, they were discontinued. 

  Responses to inquiries say, "One private researcher writes, with reference to prospective experiments with drugs, "I was told that I would have absolute discretion of refusal and that I would have final authority on experimental design and informed consent: All of this research was open and above board .. Never, never was I asked to do anything which violated medical ethics or the principles of informed consent with reference to the matters of unwitting administration of drugs, psychotropic or other, I can state categorically that no CIA person ever asked me to administer such drugs, wittingly or unwittingly. No such drugs were ever administered by me or under my direction. From the press, I have the impression that there has been an effort to caricature certain CIA individuals as pranksters. I would like to note that everything I have seen of professional CIA personnel has represented the top level of serious, dedicated, informed business ... The people who undertook this investigation were able scientists, and they selected advisors and researchers who seemed to be the individuals most able to contribute ... From a long experience with this project, I can say that I never saw a single case of experimental drug administration without informed consent."

  The president of one prominent university wrote: "If I had been at the time individually aware of such a research project and had been called. upon to pass judgment on it, I would have judged it by the merit of the particular project and not by which governmental agency was directly or indirectly sponsoring the research. As far as I am concerned the CIA is just as respectable as any other governmental agency or private foundation ... I wonder whether most of this concern about these research projects arises not out of any ethical considerations but out of hostility in certain circles toward anything done by CIA whether openly or covertly."

  In sum, if there was any unwitting drug testing sponsored directly by CIA, it seems to have been limited almost exclusively to the safehouse operations. Apart from the activities in the safe-houses we have found for the most part that CIA was interested in the results of research initiated and sponsored by other organizations and conducted in accordance with professional and ethical standards applicable to the circumstances at the time. We have found no evidence that CIA exerted undue influence or attempted in any way to coerce individuals or institutions to undertake research they might not otherwise have undertaken nor did the Agency attempt to cause any compromise of professional and ethical standards under which the research was conducted. Insofar as we are able to tell from our records, none of the research conducted by private institutions was clandestine in any way; studies were carried out openly and the results in many cases were published. As a matter of fact, it can even be reported that some significant contributions were made in the advancement of psychiatry, pharmacology, and medicine." Following the Inspector General's challenge of the program, there was a review of its nature and it was resubmitted for approval under the name of Project mksearch. Funding for mksearch commenced in FY-1966, running through 1972. There were various research activities carried on under it, but the only aspect related to behavioral drugs dealt with an inquiry in improvement by drugs of learning ability and memory retention; under this there is a record of testing on volunteers.

  Project OFTEN/CHICKWIT: In 1967 the Office of Research and Development (ORD) and the Edgewood Arsenal Research Laboratories undertook a program for doing research in influencing human behavior with drugs. A phased program was envisioned that would consist of acquisition of drugs and chemical compounds believed to have effects on the behavior of humans, and testing and evaluating these materials through laboratory procedures and toxicological studies. Compounds believed promising as a result of tests on animals were then to be evaluated clinically with human subjects at Edgewood. Substances of potential use would then be analyzed structurally as a basis for symthesizing new derivatives of greater utility. Samples of drugs and chemicals were obtained from drug and pharmaceutical companies, government agencies such as Edgewood, NIH, FDA and the Veterans Administration, as well as from research laboratories and individual researchers. Most of the materials came from the drug industry, consisting largely of substances that had been rejected because of undesired side effects from the point of view of medicinal use. Project often dealt with testing the behavioral and toxicological effects of drugs in animals and, ultimately, humans.Project chickwit was to acquire information on new drug developments in Europe and the Orient, and acquiring samples. One substance identified as a potential incapacitant was in an area known to be the subject of research by the Soviet Union, being considered a potential threat to U.S. leaders because of the ease with which it could be administered. Study of this material progressed to testing in 1971-1972 at Edgewood. This involved twenty volunteers. Records and evaluations held by CIA are limited, the program being terminated in January 1973 when final reports had not yet been prepared. Edgewood completed the follow-up testing required because of the prolonged after-effects, for which it billed CIA in April 1973, but did not provide CIA with the results. The work that continued after CIA's termination of the project was the completion of testing protocol, including interviews of subjects.<sup>[[39]](https://archive.org/details/cia-rdp-86-m-00886-r-000800010039-4)</sup></sup> <sup>[[40]](https://archive.org/details/cia-rd-and-testing-of-be-15132315)</sup></sup> <sup>[[41]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP83-00156R000300050028-0.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[42]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP83-00156R000300050037-0.pdf)</sup></sup>
   
  Conspiracy theorists claim that the CIA conducted radiation experiments on humans, as part of mkultra. However, 3 independent reviews found this was not so. CIA's History Staff conducted the most authoritative investigation onto the matter and found that it had not. This independent finding was corroborated by ACHRE's independent examination, "No evidence was found among the public or classified records to contradict CIA's conclusion that it did not engage in human radiation experiments." And, "Although CIA was a member of the Interagency Working Group on Human Radiation Experiments and possessed documents suggesting CIA involvement with human radiation experimentation, the Advisory Committee has found no evidence to indicate that CIA actually conducted or sponsored such experiments."<sup>[[43]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=660)</sup></sup> <sup>[[44]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=680)</sup></sup> <sup>[[45]](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/27/031/27031227.pdf#page=56)</sup></sup> <sup>[[46]](https://archive.org/details/csi-radiation-review)</sup></sup> <sup>[[47]](https://sgp.fas.org/library/humexp/appb.htm)</sup></sup> Further, no, the US Government didn't invent LSD.

##### Civilian

- At the request of New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services, beginning in 2005 the Vera Institute of Justice undertook an in-depth examination of issues related to the enrollment and monitoring of New York City foster children in clinical trials related to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The request was prompted by allegations that African American and Latino children were inappropriately removed from their families and placed in foster care to facilitate their enrollment in dangerous and unnecessary medical experiments. Other concerns included whether children suffered unnecessarily as a result of their participation, whether children in trials were HIV infected, whether trial researchers properly obtained informed consent, and whether the child welfare system adequately monitored the children in their care. Vera reviewers found little or no evidence in the information examined for some of the concerns that prompted Children’s Services to initiate this study. Many children—inside and outside of foster care and clinical trials—died because of complications of HIV/AIDS during the late 1980s and 1990s. Eighty of the 532 children who participated in clinical trials or observational studies died while in foster care; 25 of them died while enrolled in a medication trial. Vera medical staff did not find, however, that any child’s death was caused directly by clinical trial medication. An examination of data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, though not conclusive, suggests that HIV-positive foster children who were enrolled in clinical trials and/or observational research studies did not experience an increased risk of death from their enrollment in clinical trials.

  The child welfare files contained information indicating that some children experienced serious toxicities, or side effects, from trial medications, such as reduced liver function or severe anemia. These toxicities were consistent with toxicities described in published articles about the trials. Vera reviewers found many instances where a physician made adjustments to a child’s treatment in light of these problems as required by the clinical trial protocol. Where documentation allowed reviewers to make a determination, children in foster care met age, HIV status, and disease stage criteria for inclusion in the specific trials in which they were enrolled as described in the trial protocol. Reviewers found that two of the 532 children met exclusion criteria for the medication trials in which they were enrolled. In 1988, when city officials first considered the participation of foster children in clinical trials, the child welfare agency conducted a lengthy review of state and federal research regulations. The social services commissioner and his staff were aware of concerns about the participation of African American and Latino children in medical research and they consulted with several medical experts, including the National Medical Association (an organization of African American physicians). The standard the agency developed for approving trials—that every child in foster care enrolled in a trial have the possibility of benefiting from that trial— exceeded that of federal regulations. The policy also required that researchers obtain informed consent from a birth parent when parental rights remained intact. Many files document medical researchers’ discussions of the risks and potential benefits of trial enrollment with a birth parent and the parent’s subsequent permission to enroll the child. In several cases, parents did not want their children in a clinical trial and the child did not participate in the trial. Children in foster care appeared to participate in trials at rates that suggest they were not specially targeted for enrollment into HIV/AIDS clinical trials. Foster children made up 30 percent of all New York City enrollments in 16 trials of medical interventions for which city- level data were available. Thirteen percent of these enrollments occurred prior to the child’s entry into foster care, with participation extending into the period they were in foster care.
  
  Children in foster care who participated in HIV/AIDS clinical trials were predominantly African American and Latino (64 percent African American and 30 percent Latino). This demographic profile paralleled the demographics of children with HIV infection in New York City (58 percent African American, 35 percent Latino). There was no evidence in the child welfare files of children being removed from their families by Children’s Services because a parent refused to consent to a child’s participation in a clinical trial. Vera reviewers found no evidence in the child welfare files, clinical trial protocols, or interviews that children, parents, foster parents, foster care agencies or staff, or child welfare agencies or staff received incentive payments for children to participate in clinical trials.<sup>[[49]](http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat4/150521.pdf)</sup></sup>

- From 1945 through 1947 Manhattan Project researchers injected eighteen human subjects with plutonium, five human subjects with polonium, and six human subjects with uranium to obtain metabolic data related to the safety of those working on the production of nuclear weapons. All of these subjects were patients hospitalized at facilities affiliated with the Universities of Rochester (11 patients), California (3 patients), and Chicago (3 patients) or at Oak Ridge (1 patient). Another set of experiments took place between 1953 and 1957 at Massachusetts General Hospital, in which 11 patients with terminal conditions were injected with uranium. All were near death (in a coma or semicoma) prior to injection and were receiving usual hospital care for comatose patients. The subjects expired from their brain cancer within several months of injection. Study results indicated that 99 percent of the injected uranium cleared the blood within 20 hours. This wasn't a government program, so to speak. It was a collection of a few individuals at universities who coordinated on their own. How all the injections were coordinated—or even if they were coordinated—is unclear.<sup>[[50]](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10111991)</sup></sup> 
 
  Further, ACHRE couldn't determine if those involved provided consent, due to obvious limitations. Some did consent, others may not have. As one officer said, "It is unlikely that these tests were made without the consent of the subjects." Which supports a claim made by one of the Chicago doctors in 1974 that some form of oral consent for the injections had been obtained. When the civilian AEC took over for the Manhattan District on January 1, 1947, the plutonium injections provoked a strong reaction at the highest levels. Concern for minimizing risk of harm to subjects is evident in several of the planning documents relating to the experiments, an obligation that many of those involved apparently took seriously. At Chicago, for example, where the highest doses of plutonium were used, care was taken to ensure that all the subjects had terminal illnesses.<sup>[[51]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=255)</sup></sup> 
 
  A 1962 paper, openly published, said that, "During the early days of the Manhattan Project, the excretion and retention data on which to base a method of diagnosing Pu239 body burden were largely from experiments on rats. It seemed imperative, therefore, to determine retention and excretion in a limited number of terminal human patients. Sixteen cases were studied, the first beginning in April of 1945. Life expectancy of the individual and relative freedom from kidney disease were the principle criteria for case selection. As a rule, individuals were chosen who were past 45 yr of age and who were suffering from well-established disorders that made survival for 10 or more years highly improbable. Adherence to this rule avoided the possibility of development of late radiation effects from plutonium." The study notes that many such patients died within 30 days, due to their terminal illness. Only 3 lived the full 138-day observation period."<sup>[[52]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16369158-b6Yb0H/16369158.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Historical revisionists have long-claimed that the US conducted unethical research on Children with radiation. However, a critical examination of the record reflects this is not so. Although in the 1940s and 1950s there were apparently no written rules of professional ethics for pediatric research in general, there were guidelines for the investigational use of radioisotopes in children. In 1949, the Subcommittee on Human Applications of the Atomic Energy Commission's Isotope Division established a set of rules to judge proposals submitted by researchers for the use of radioisotopes in medical experiments with human subjects, including "normal children."" These standards appeared in the fall 1949 supplement to the AEC's isotope catalogue and price list.
 
  These guidelines did not mention consent--of parents, guardians, or children. Instead, this statement simply discouraged nontherapeutic experiments with children. The guidelines did not, however, suggest that the practice was completely inappropriate; the subcommittee asserted that "important" research using "harmless" levels of radiation dosage with children was acceptable. The crucial terms important and harmless were left undefined. It seems reasonable to expect that "important" pediatric research would address a significant medical problem affecting children or would explore key aspects of normal human physiology-relevant to health promotion or disease Part II prevention— for which research on children is indispensable. By these standards, the twenty-one nontherapeutic radiation experiments with children whose risks we review in the next section of this chapter could all be said to address important questions relevant to pediatric health care. During the 1944-1974 period, there was an explosion of interest in the use of radioisotopes in clinical medicine and medical research, including pediatrics. The twenty-one research projects we review here include only a small number of all those that were likely conducted. These twenty-one do include, however, every nontherapeutic study that was funded by the federal government and fell into our original group of eighty-one pediatric radiation experiments.
  
  All twenty-one projects analyzed in detail involve the administration of radioisotopes to children in order to better understand child physiology or to develop better diagnostic tools for pediatric disease. In this respect, the studies supported by the federal government do not differ from those reviewed that had other funding sources. With the exception of the study at the Wrentham school to evaluate protective measures for fallout, none of the twenty-one experiments reviewed was related to national defense concerns. Seventeen of the twenty-one experiments involved the use of iodine 131 for the evaluation of thyroid function.<sup>[[53]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=345)</sup></sup>
  
- A number of myths surround Walter E. Fernald State School, in which sensational allegations claimed residents who were mentally ill were subject to radiation experiments. However, an independent review found the opposite, "Of significant note is that no research was identified by the Task Force that involved testing the effect of radiation on human beings by introducing radioactive materials purposefully into their bodies to measure or monitor such effects. The nutritional research studies used small amounts of radioactive material as tracer elements to understand how the body functioned or obtained elements from the diet; the Thyroid studies used small to large amounts of tracer materials, also to learn about body functions; and, the so-called Cold War study at Wrentham differed in that the tracer materials were used to find the point at which administration of iodine blocked the uptake of radioactive materials that would be found in nuclear fallout."

  Further, it will be stated that many of the people who became residents of the Walter E. Fernald School, from its opening in 1848 right through the 1950s, were not admitted with a diagnosis of mental retardation. Societal and cultural norms of the day permitted persons to be admitted to state-operated institutions for a number of reasons. All were labeled mentally retarded just by virtue of having lived within the facility. The Task Force asks that the general public and members of the press take special note that these labels are grossly inaccurate, misleading, and simply not true.<sup>[[54]](https://ia902209.us.archive.org/31/items/reportonuseofrad00mass/reportonuseofrad00mass.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[55]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222994/)</sup></sup>
  
- The Tuskegee experiment,1932. This has been subject to a lot of disinformation and popular myth. I'll quote at length from a 2005 Lancet Infectious Diseases article that corrects the distorted record on the episode<sup>[[56]](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(05)01286-7/fulltext)</sup></sup>: "More than a quarter of black Americans questioned in a recent survey believe that AIDS was produced in a laboratory, and 16% believe that it was created by the US government to control the black population. In attempting to explain why such mistaken notions are so widely held, Laura Bogart, lead author of the study, says: “Conspiracy beliefs stem from current and historical discrimination against blacks in our health-care system, including the Tuskegee syphilis study”. The Tuskegee study has become the archetype of unethical research and racism in medicine. However, by citing Tuskegee, is Bogart merely invoking one set of conspiracy beliefs to explain another? Between 1932 and 1972, the US Public Health Service (USPHS) studied 600 black men, 399 with untreated latent syphilis and 201 uninfected controls, living around Tuskegee, Macon County, Alabama. Although there was no study protocol, the purpose of the Tuskegee experiments seems to have been to observe patients with untreated latent syphilis to autopsy and verify the presence or absence of syphilitic destructive lesions. According to a detailed analysis of the Tuskegee study by Robert M White in Archives of Internal Medicine, USPHS officers believed that the study “should forever dispel the rather general belief that syphilis is a disease of small consequence to the negro”. Many aspects of the conduct of the Tuskegee study are beyond dispute. The men who took part were not told their diagnosis and were misled into believing they were receiving treatment, when in fact most were never adequately treated, even when penicillin became available. However, a pervasive myth that must be dispelled is that patients were deliberately infected with syphilis. The truth is that the infected men had had syphilis for several years at the time they were recruited. It is debatable whether the study was racist. All the patients and controls were black (as was 82% of the population of Macon County in 1930), but this was because the study has its origins in earlier work supported by the philanthropic Rosenwald Fund, with the motivation of promoting the welfare of African Americans. Although the Rosenwald Fund decided not to support the Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis, it was endorsed by the Tuskegee Institute—an entirely African-American organisation—and black health-care professionals were involved at all stages of the study. Indeed, as late as 1969, the Macon County Medical Society, consisting mostly of black doctors, agreed to assist the USPHS in continuing the study.

    To describe the Tuskegee study as unethical requires an element of what Richard A Shweder describes as “presentism” (ie, judging past actions on the basis of the standards of today). When the study began, the only treatment for syphilis was the poorly efficacious arsphenamine compounds, and there was no medical consensus on the usefulness of these drugs in latent syphilis. And debate over whether treatment of latent syphilis did more harm than good continued into the early 1950s, well into the era of penicillin availability. We should also bear in mind that in the 1930s there were no written standards for experimentation with human beings, and the paternalistic attitude that pervaded medical practice at the time meant that the norms for informing patients about their illness were very different from now. Therefore, it is hard to imagine that a hypothetical institutional review board of the 1930s would have judged the Tuskegee study unethical at its inception. However, principles for research with human beings were adopted by the American Medical Association in 1946, and by the 1950s programmes for penicillin treatment of syphilis were widespread across the USA. Thus, by its 20th anniversary the Tuskegee study had become unethical by the standards of the time—patients should have been informed of their diagnosis and given the option of treatment. To use the “Tuskegee effect” to explain the disengagement by many black Americans with the reality of AIDS is perhaps understandable, given the way the study has been popularly interpreted. However, focus-group research shows that the public is able to weigh current concerns against worries about the Tuskegee study. The Tuskegee experiment deserves re-examination, free of our contemporary prejudices, before it is again deployed as a symbol of conspiracy."<sup>[[57]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/224795)</sup></sup> <sup>[[58]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2568733/pdf/jnma00185-0122.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[59]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1043659608314196)</sup></sup>

- Between 1974 and 75, it was alleged that the US Indian Health Service engaged in a forced sterilization effort against the natives without their consent. However, an independent 1976 GAO investigation found this allegation baseless. Concluding: "We found no evidence that IHS sterilising Indians without a patient consent form on file, although we did find several weaknesses in complying with HEW's sterilization regulations. The primary weaknesses related to (1) sterilization of persons under 21 years of age, (2) inadequately documenting what the Indian subjects were told before singing the consent form (largely attributable to the the use of consent forms that failed to meet HEW standards), (3) lack of widespread physician understanding of the regulations, and (4) the lack of definitive requirements for informed consent when sterilizations are performed by contract doctors at contract facilities."<sup>[[1]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/hrd-77-3.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists claim that the FBI/local Police assassinated Fred Hampton. On November 1969, black panther extremists shot and killed two police officers and wounding several more. The FBI obtained information that the extremist group had a stockpile of various items at 2337 West Monroe Street, Chicago.  5 carbines with 50,000 rounds of ammunition, 3 gas masks, 3 smoke bombs, 5 Ithaca riot shotguns plus ammunition, 4-38 caliber handguns plus ammunition and one .357 magnum plus ammunition. Additional information came in that there included illegal weapons and stolen Police weapons. The Police/FBI had no knowledge that Hampton was present. A Grand Jury investigation, which examined all investigations, autopsies, toxicology reports, and testimony found that the assassination theory to be without merit: The autopsy conducted by Dr. Petty at the Shreveport Louisiana Veterans Hospital, with Grand Jury attorneys present, was extraordinarily thorough. An X-ray study of the entire body was made, and color and black and white photographs were taken at every stage of the examination. This autopsy conclusively confirmed the findings of the FBI and the coroner's chemist that there was no trace of drugs in the body through extensive cultural analyses of the stomach, kidneys, liver, brain and other organs; samples of these organs were contemporaneously obtained by the Hampton family pathologist and the coroner's pathologists." This report finds that the justification for the search warrant was narrow and not politically motivated. This Earth-shattering report also refutes the family and Panther "investigations," by pointing out their bias, "The Black Panther Party investigation also included the retention of a private pathologist who on December 5, 1969, performed a second autopsy on the body of Fred Hampton. Again, before beginning his work, this pathologist was briefed as to the defense theory that Hampton was intentionally murdered... One of the significant impressions the Grand Jury obtained from parts of the investigation conducted by the survivors' attorneys—and, indeed, from parts of the official investigation as well-was the extent to which the predisposition of the individuals conducting the investigations affects the result. Any investigation that is designed to prove a theory rather than establish the facts has to be thoughtfully scrutinized and should not be accepted as objective without such scrutiny...This mistake combined with the mistaken drug analysis, the erroneous classification of the shoulder wound as a graze, the confusion over the recovery of a bullet by the coroner and the defense counsels' predilection for accusatory press conferences, contributed significantly to exacerbating community tension. Plainly, a careful and objective approach to the second autopsy could have prevented this unnecessary conflict over the cause of death." The report also examines the FBI and other forensic studies of the scene, and finds that while on other matters, the Officer's testimony are corroborated by evidence, on ballistics—it does not. It is confirmed that the occupants fired the first shot from the shotgun, there was confusion among the officers in the dark apartment, leading them to conclude that the shots fired from other officers in response to the shotgun were coming from the panthers. It was determined that only one shot, the shotgun, was fired from the panthers. These findings are what caused the Government to conclude the indictments be dismissed against the remaining survivors in the interest of justice. It should be noted, as the report finds: These survivors could have provided valuable insight into what happened, however, they refused to testify.<sup>[[1]](https://ia601200.us.archive.org/18/items/Grand-Jury-Fred-Hampton-1970/Hampton.-1970-FGJ-Report.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1968, Martin Luther King (MLK) Jr was assassinated by James Earl Ray. Some allege that the FBI or CIA were involved in his death. HSCA investigated allegations that the Government (Federal, State and local), were involved in MLK's assassination. HSCA concluded none of the proffered evidence supported the claim, "No Federal, State or Local Government Agency was Involved in the Assassination of Dr. King."<sup>[[1]](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-1)</sup></sup> HSCA also independently confirms the DOJ's 1977 Task Force report on FBI's interactions with MLK. "The Task Force concluded, however, that the evidence was overwhelming that Ray was a lone assassin, and it found no evidence of FBI involvement."<sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/mlktaskforce)</sup></sup>

  Conspiracy theorists repeat the mantra that, "the government was found guilty, being responsible for the assassination of MLK!" However, this was in a civil case—where the standard of evidence is far, far lower. Nonetheless, as a result, another independent investigation was ordered to examine all the evidence in the civil case—what followed was a landmark refutation. "The evidence introduced in King v. Jowers to support various conspiracy allegations consisted of either inaccurate and incomplete information or unsubstantiated conjecture, supplied most often by sources, many unnamed, who did not testify. Important information from the historical record and our investigation contradicts and undermines it. When considered in light of all other available relevant facts, the trial's evidence fails to establish the existence of any conspiracy to kill Dr. King. The verdict presented by the parties and adopted by the jury is incompatible with the weight of all relevant information, much of which the jury never heard. After reviewing all available materials from prior official investigations and other sources, including the evidence from King v. Jowers, and after conducting a year and a half of original investigation, we have concluded that the allegations originating with Loyd Jowers and Donald Wilson are not credible.

  We found no reliable evidence to support Jowers' allegations that he conspired with others to shoot Dr. King from behind Jim's Grill. In fact, credible evidence contradicting his allegations, as well as material inconsistencies among his accounts and his own repudiations of them, demonstrate that Jowers has not been truthful. Rather, it appears that Jowers contrived and promoted a sensational story of a plot to kill Dr. King. Likewise, we do not credit Donald Wilson's claim that he took papers from Ray's abandoned car. Wilson has made significant contradictory statements and otherwise behaved in a duplicitous manner, inconsistent with his professed interest in seeking the truth. Important evidence contradicting Wilson's claims, including the failure of James Earl Ray to support Wilson's revelation, further undermines his account. Although we were unable to determine the true origin of the Wilson documents, his inconsistent statements, his conduct, and substantial evidence refuting his claims all demonstrate that his implausible account is not worthy of belief. Accordingly, we have concluded that the documents do not constitute evidence relevant to the King assassination.

  The weight of the evidence available to our investigation also establishes that Raoul is merely the creation of James Earl Ray. We found no evidence to support the claims that a Raoul participated in the assassination. Rather, a review of 30 years of speculation about his identity presents a convincing case that no Raoul was involved in a conspiracy to kill Dr. King. In accordance with our mandate, we confined our investigation to the Jowers and the Wilson allegations and logical investigative leads suggested by them, including those concerning Raoul, who is central to both allegations. We however considered other allegations, including the unsubstantiated claims made during the trial of King v. Jowers that government agencies and African American ministers associated with Dr. King conspired to kill him. Where warranted, we conducted limited additional investigation. Thus, we evaluated all additional allegations brought to our attention to determine whether any reliable substantiation exists to credit them or warrant further inquiry. We found none. Similarly, we considered the suggestion of the House Select Committee on Assassinations and the Shelby County District Attorney General to investigate whether James Earl Ray's surviving brothers may have been his co-conspirators. We found insufficient evidentiary leads remaining after 30 years to justify further investigation. Finally, while we conducted no original investigation specifically directed at determining whether James Earl Ray killed Dr. King, we found no credible evidence to disturb past judicial determinations that he did."<sup>[[3]](https://ia600601.us.archive.org/33/items/mlk-doj-rev.pdf/MLK_DOJ_rev.pdf.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/government-mlk-assassination/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/17/instagram-posts/fact-checking-old-conspiracy-about-martin-luther-k/)</sup></sup>

- In 1967, Soviet disinformation outlet, Il Paese Sera, claimed that it was the CIA that was behind the assassination of JFK. This classic case of Russian fake news has been refuted by several Congressional investigations, the DOJ, FBI and outside forensic experts.<sup>[[1]](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Lie-That-Linked-CIA-to-the-Kennedy-Zelikow-Holland/1ba2b788218120e9e205ae7d9bb1877cdb3cb405)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://theconversation.com/jfk-conspiracy-theory-is-debunked-in-mexico-57-years-after-kennedy-assassination-148138)</sup></sup> The Warren Commission and HSCA both concluded no involvement on behalf of the US Government agencies, Cubans or Soviet Union, "Based on the committee's entire investigation, it concluded that the Secret Service, FBI and CIA were not involved in the assassination. The committee concluded that it is probable that the President was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. Nothing in the committee's investigation pointed to official involvement in that conspiracy. While the committee frankly acknowledged that its investigation was not able to identify the members of the conspiracy besides Oswald, or the extent of the conspiracy, the committee believed that it did not include the Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, or Central Intelligence Agency."<sup>[[3]](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-1)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://ia800705.us.archive.org/30/items/COUNTERINGCRITICISMOFTHEWARRENREPORT/COUNTERING%20CRITICISM%20OF%20THE%20WARREN%20REPORT.pdf)</sup></sup> Further, it should be noted that HSCA was heavily rebuked for some of its characterisations about Intelligence Community sharing with Congressional investigations, as well as their characterisations of CIA products.<sup>[[5]](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/104-10320-10121.pdf)</sup></sup> However, yes, the HSCA believed there was evidence of a second shooter.<sup>[[6]](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1c.html)</sup></sup> This was concluded based on flawed acoustic analysis.

  An earth-shattering 2019 study, published in the prestigious American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology, reexamined the wound ballistics caused WCC 6.5-mm Carcano bullets. It finds that the inherent design of these bullets causes the unusual wounding, not seen by more modern rounds. Indeed, other bullets from the 1800s and 1900s were examined, and found similar results, "All of these bullets were found to behave in the same manner as the 6.5-mm WCC Carcano bullet when fired into soft tissue simulants. These results showed that it is the design, not the caliber or weight, that dictates this unusual, but not unique, wound ballistic behavior." It continues, "The exterior and wound ballistic evidence in the November 1963 assassination of President Kennedy was there from the beginning: 1) the initial perforating gunshot wound to the President by the so-called magic bullet, which lost very little velocity (ca. 150 ft/s) as it exited his throat with a residual velocity on the order of 1800 ft/s. 2) the lack of any subsequent ballistic damage to the presidential limousine, which would be obvious from a heavy, full metal jacket rifle bullet exiting the President's body at, or near, the afore-described velocity of 1800 ft/s. 3) The yawed entry wound in Governor Connally's back and the corresponding yawed entry hole in the back of his suit coat. 4) The demonstrated deep penetrating capabilities of the 6.5-mm Carcano bullet combined with its unusual ability to remain nose-forward during its primary penetration and perforation of soft tissue. 5) the WCC Carcano bullet's ability to totally change character into that of an expanding bullet once its nose area is breached by striking thick bone. In this situation, testing by this author and others (Lattimer and Sturdivan) has shown that the nose of the full metal jacket Carcano bullet can be breeched upon striking skull bone, after which the bullet behaves much like a soft-point hunting bullet. These properties were not known to law enforcement and medical investigators in 1963, and they remain little known or understood today. The unusual and uncommon wound ballistic behaviors of the 6.5-mm Carcano bullet and other military rifle bullets of the same basic design have been explained and demonstrated. The early notion that one bullet could not possibly pass through 2 people has been disproved. As a result of the many shooting tests carried out by this writer, the 6.5-mm Carcano bullet could pass through 3 adult victims if they were lined up and essentially in contact with each other."<sup>[[9]](https://journals.lww.com/amjforensicmedicine/abstract/2019/12000/the_unique_and_misunderstood_wound_ballistics_in.6.aspx)</sup></sup>

  Another ground-breaking 2022 study, published in the Journal, Forensic Science International, used Computational ballistic analysis with the evidence, and found, "The presented simulations support the official commission reports regarding origin and direction of the fatal head shot to John F. Kennedy. From a mechanical standpoint, based on computational simulation, JFK’s head was hit by a single bullet from the rear originating from the Texas School Book Depository. Deformation patterns regarding skull fracture and bullet jacket deformation as shown in photographs could be matched by simulation with unambiguous consistency, leaving little room for further speculation about the origin of the projectile. Simulated post-impact head motion corresponds to evidence provided by the Zapruder Film. Simulation results together with forensic evidence exclude the sites "Grassy Knoll, South Knoll, and storm drain", as potential origins of the fatal shot."<sup>[[10]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379073822000949)</sup></sup>

  Did JFK say, "splinter the C.I.A. in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.” Most likely not. Versions of the quote goes as far back as 1819 and 1840.

  The other quote conspiracy theorists attribute to JFK, “There’s a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child. Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot.”  does not exist. This was never said. “We’ve been asked about this quote (and a few variations of it) many times and we’ve never found any evidence that John F. Kennedy said or wrote it,” Stacey Chandler, a reference archivist at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, wrote in an email to the AP. Marc Selverstone, an associate professor at the University of Virginia and chair of the Presidential Recordings Program, has also seen this quote circulate many times and told the AP that he has never seen it in a reputable source.

  Chandler explained that the quote is often claimed to have come from a speech Kennedy supposedly gave at Columbia University in November 1963, either on Nov. 15 or Nov. 12. However, there is no indication Kennedy ever spoke at Columbia University on these dates or any other time in 1963, she said. Staff at the presidential library have also searched for the quote across archival documents, historical newspaper coverage and speech databases like The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “We haven’t found a match for this statement through any of these resources or via cited secondary sources,” said Chandler. John Woolley, the co-director of The American Presidency Project, told the AP that he couldn’t find evidence of the Kennedy quote in the collection, either. “In his public remarks there is nothing at all resembling this statement in the period from November 12-14,”<sup>[[15]](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-JFK-fake-quote-conspiracy-theory-672501330708)</sup></sup>

  Lastly, it should also be noted that it was JFK that botched the Bay of Pigs, not the CIA. So, no, he'd have no reason to "get rid of the Agency". Further still, he couldn't. CIA is established by law, not Executive Order.<sup>[[16]](https://archive.org/details/BayOfPigsVolumeIVTheTaylorCommitteeInvestigationOfTheBayOfPigs)</sup></sup> <sup>[[17]](https://archive.org/details/cia-bay-of-pigs-v )</sup></sup> <sup>[[18]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201119135647/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000129913.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Some conspiracy theorists have tried to suggest that the US sabotaged the M16, during the Vietnam war. That, "The United States Government knowingly set up their own rifles for failure, resulting in the deaths of countless American lives." To support this conspiracy theory, they selectively quote a 56-page, 1967 subcommittee report—also known as the Ichord report. However, nowhere in the report does it make this claim. Further, they quote where the committee believes there was criminal negligence. However, a 1968 independent panel, which conducted a more thorough study, issued a 1,507-page investigation report of the M-16 program, which cross-examined more records and people—it also reviewed the Subcommittee report. It finds, "no data has been located which would support any negligence on the part of officials within the Army. After a complete and comprehensive review of the Small Arms Weapon Systems (SAWS) study which surfaced system deficiencies at a high level, broad and significant direction was provided to investigate cause and effect relationships on the reported malfunctions and to make necessary corrective actions. This direction was provided in 1966." They also quote from the subcommittee, suggesting how the Army behaved/managed the program was "unbelievable". However, the independent panel review finds, "the M16 rifle program was atypical of Army management programs. This rifle entered the inventory as an "off-the-shelf" procurement and did not go through the normal research and development process. This problem was recognized and in the late summer of 1966 an intensive review was conducted which resulted in key decisions and positive guidance." 

  Also quote-mined from the subcommittee, "that the major contributor to malfunctions experienced in Vietnam was ammunition loaded with ball powder." However, per the panel review, "Failure to extract is the most serious malfunction experienced by US Forces in Vietnam and this malfunction has not been positively identified with ball propellant. Rather, it is due to poor cleaning, worn extractors and extractor springs, and corroded and pitted chambers. This problem was recognized and was the basis for the Army's decision to incorporate a chromed chamber." Or the subcommittee's finding, "that the sole-source position enjoyed by Olin Mathieson on ball propellants for many years and their close relationship with the Army may have influenced the decision-makers at Army Munitions Command, etc." The panel review, however, says, "no data has been identified which would indicate that the relationship has influenced decision-makers." Or, concerning the "unethical" comment concerning MG Lynde, the panel finds, "no data has been located which would substantiate this finding."<sup>[[1]](https://ia600701.us.archive.org/12/items/m16reviewpanelfull/m16reviewpanelfull.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- Between 1956 and 1971, the FBI conducted a series of lawful activities, under COINTELPRO—in response to Congressional and public demand for stronger response, to counter and disrupt white supremacist hate groups (such as the KKK), black and far left extremist groups, who were engaged in violent activity aimed against the government, including: bombings, kidnappings, arson and murder. It also countered foreign intelligence services operating in the US, using these groups that declared publicly to, "bring the government to is knees."
It was not a domestic spy operation aimed at political dissidents, as historical revisionists claim. Only a handful of isolated incidents exceeded the FBI's mandate. Care was taken to maintain respect for the First Amendment throughout all activities.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/cointelproreport-1)</sup></sup>  

- Some political pundits allege that CIA's first "interrogation manual" condoned torture. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. Even as far back as 1958, a Studies in Intelligence article emphasised that  "torture must not be used, the article said, not only for moral and legal reasons but because it risks producing bad information and rendering the subject unfit for further use." It did suggest that “intensive” interrogation occasion ally was needed, a “softening up process" intended to "break" the detainee’s will, but not by crossing the line into physical abuse or torture. “The recalcitrant subject of an intelligence interrogation must be ‘broken,’ but broken for use like a riding horse, not smashed in the search for a single golden egg." A late 60s Studies in Intelligence article reflects a similar warning, that violence "often gets crude results quickly" because it “lowers the moral caliber of the organization employing it and soon corrupts the interrogation staff." As noted by Historian Nicholas Dujmovic, "The evidence suggests CIA took this admonition against physical abuse seriously." Since "in 1960, a CIA employee beat a Soviet bloc defector undergoing interrogation, and DCI Allen Dulles summarily dismissed him." He further observes that, "When coercive methods needed to be used, the strictest control was the norm." The alleged evidence by historical revisionists, that the CIA condoned torture is the 1963 "Kubark manual", which was more akin to an "academic discussion" of the pros and cons of various interrogation methods—landing on the side against torture. In it, "Most of the discussion concerns psychological stresses, such as the arrest itself, with only a short general discussion on the infliction of pain that emphasizes its potential to be counterproductive. Most interesting is the warning that no CIA interrogator can unilaterally use any form of coercion and that prior approval mu t be obtained from the CIA director." As Dujmovic finds, "Agency experience regarding interrogation goes back more than 50 years, and that record makes clear two things: first, that coercive methods have always been considered effective to some degree; second, that they have to be used carefully and not devolve into torture."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/cia%20and%20interrogations-to%5B15490493%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/static/5e897e8297cc9446cc7a884703bcf6ef/Review-The-Good-Shepherd.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Other revisionists contend that the CIA tortured and drugged Soviet defector Yuri Nosenko. However, this never happened. He was subject to bare minimum living conditions—such as denied basic comforts and isolated—but never physically abused or drugged. They also point to the 1983  Human Resource Exploitation (HRE) manual as evidence of CIA's involvement in torture—yet, just like the works before it—explicitly prohibit and call to attention the negative impact of torture and abuse, on the very first page.<sup>[[3]](https://ia802905.us.archive.org/21/items/CIAHumanResourceExploitationManual_201702/CIA%20Human%20Resource%20Exploitation%20Manual.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Between 1953 to 1973, the CIA with the United States Postal Service (USPS), operated a mail program to "give United States intelligence agencies insight into Soviet intelligence activities and interests." This took place primarily in New York. While some point to the Rockefeller Commission as suggesting this program was unlawful, a renowned scholar notes, "A more extensive analysis of the program, however, indicates that the mail cover portion of the program was legal throughout its duration, while the mail opening portion was legal during its peak years, and may have been since its inception." After a detailed examination, concludes, Thus, it would appear that the CIA's mail cover program was legal during its operation. It did not violate any criminal or civil statute, constitutional provision, or the National Security Act. In addition, contrary to the unspecified claims made by the Rockefeller Commission, the CIA's mail cover operation did not violate postal service regulations." These findings were independently concluded in a 1977 DOJ review.<sup>[[1]](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ilj#page=31)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3540126/CIA-RDP04M01816R000502010009-4-Compressed.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Further, it is alleged by conspiracy theorists that between 1967 and 1974, Operation CHAOS, a CIA foreign intelligence program, was actually a domestic spy program aimed at disrupting First Amendment activities of US citizens. However, the declassified records contradict this claim outright. "CHAOS was a foreign intelligence collection program, aimed at assessing foreign intelligence interference in the dissident movements. A handful of officers incidentally did end up acquiring such information while they were in the United States bolstering their dissident credentials. There is no indication, however, that anyone connected to Operation CHAOS utilized clandestine means, such as electronic surveillance, wiretaps, or break-ins, to acquire any of this information. When then CIA Director Richard Helms informed President Johnson that the Agency could not spy on Americans, President Johnson stated: 'I'm quite aware of that. What I want for you is to pursue this matter, and to do what is necessary to track down the foreign communists who are behind this intolerable interference in our domestic affairs.' It appears that the Agency did just that-focusing not on the domestic facets of the movement, but rather on the connection of foreign entities to it. As the Rockefeller Commission found the program to be lawful, "the subject matter of the information and not the location of its source is the principal factor that determines whether it is within the purview of the CIA. As one scholar finds, in his careful, thorough, and incisive study reveals: "Applying this to Operation CHAOS under the Act as it existed in 1973, most of the activities undertaken by the Agency were entirely legal. The stated purpose of the Agency's activities in tracking dissident movements was to determine the foreign influences, if any, on those movement. Thus, the purpose was not to collect domestic information, nor to collect information for the purpose of prosecution (i.e., law enforcement), but rather for foreign intelligence purposes. The collection therefore fell within the confines of the Act and was entirely permissible. The Rockefeller Commission came to the same conclusion."<sup>[[3]](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ilj#page=48)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/1075833)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://archive.org/details/activities-possible)</sup></sup>

- Historical revisionists claim that the CIA created and influenced American political groups, such as the Congress for Cultural Freedom and National Student Association between 1949 and 1967. This also ignores the fact that it was the Soviets who first used art and literature, and orginisations of KGB-control and making, to push disinformation. The US merely countered with truth. A ground-breaking, never-before-seen incisive study exposes this fraudulent communist narrative. The US merely funded, but did not influence the free intellectual thought and debate. Unlike the Soviet's use of such groups, US groups included diverse opinions of free-thought, even promoting anti-American narratives. Stalin's recourse to political subversion as his primary weapon against the Marshall Plan in Western Europe placed new emphasis on the international front groups the Soviets had been building since 1945. In late 1948, Moscow began stepping up its efforts to capitalize on the popular dread of another terrible war. German diplomat Gustav Hilger, who had been one of Hitler's foremost Soviet experts, explained to an internal CIA audience that Moscow sought to convince people "that the maintenance of world peace depends solely on the further attitude of the Western Powers because the Soviet Union had sufficiently proved that it wants peace." Beginning in Wroclaw, Poland, in September 1948, Soviet agents built their campaign to influence Western opinion around a series of international "cultural" conferences designed to provide stages for Communist-inspired pronouncements calling for world peace and condemning the Truman administration's increasingly confrontational policies. Conferences scheduled for Mexico City, New York. and Paris aimed at convincing Western artists, writers, and scholars that Moscow was the last hope for world peace.

  The "peace offensive" came to the United States in March 1949 with the opening of the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace at New York City's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Conference organizers copied the fonnat of the Comintem-inspired congresses of writers and artists of the 1930s, attracting a panoply of American writers and artists, including Lillian Hellman, Aaron Copland, and Arthur Miller. The delegates joined with European and Soviet delegates to repudiate "U.S. war-mongering." Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, for example, told the delegates that "a small clique of hatemongers" was preparing a global conflagration, and he urged progressive artists to struggle against the new "Fascists" who were seeking world domination. Shostakovich, who had recently penned an ode to Stalin's forestry program, also described for his 800 listeners "the unheard-of scope and level of development reached by musical culture in the USSR." American panelists echoed the Russian composer's fear of a new global conflict Playwright Clifford Odets, for example, denounced the "enemies of Man" and claimed that fraudulent reports of Soviet aggression had whipped the United States into "a state of holy terror." Composer Aaron Copland declared "the present policies of the American Government will lead inevitably into a third world war." American Presidents from Harry Truman to Lyndon Johnson approved CIA programs to shore up and strengthen private anti-Communist US organizations.

  On the Congress for Cultural Freedom, "Silone was subtler, urging the West to promote social and political reforms to co-opt Communism's still-influential moral appeal. Silone's ideas echoed the strategy that OPC adopted to guide its operations. Instead of backing the political right in Europe and Asia, OPC would back the "non-Communist left" as the must reliable bulwark against Communism. Silone and other thinkers of the non-Communist left suggested that only socialism or social democracy could lend the West the vision and the legitimacy to attain peace and prosperity-and thus dry up the sources of Communism's popular support. Whatever their misgivings about socialism, OPC officers conceded the strategic acumen of this thought. The competing ideas of Koestler and Silone lent a certain dramatic tension to the Congress, but their rivalry by itself confirmed that debate in the West was truly free, with room for all shades of anti-totalitarian opinion.

  The accomplishments of both the Congress and the QKOPERA project must be credited in no small part to one man-Michael Josselson. The project's forays into American politics-its use of prominent Americans as unwilling spokesmen and agents, as well as CCFs subsidi­zation of criticism of US policies—are also attributed to Josselson. From the early 1950s onward, Headquarters trusted Josselson and followed his lead when it came to balancing the project's anti-Communist mission against the need to maintain credibility among foreign intellectuals who were sometimes critical of the United States.

  Josselson insisted from the start that the Congress's credibility with the non-Communist left depended on its willingness to criticize American foreign and domestic policies. This belief was evidently heartfelt Josselson himself was a man of the non-Communist left, occasionally voicing strong opinions about American political develop­ments. He viewed with horror the growing conservative intellectual movement, and he privately denounced William F. Buckley's magazine National Review. He later doubted the wisdom of America's deepening involvement in Vietnam and commended Senator George McGovern's criticism of Johnson administration policies there.''" With Josselson in charge, the Congressional secretariat did not hesitate to criticize injustice in the United States. For instance, in the wake or civil rights protests at the University of Alabama, a CCF committee cabled anti-segregation messages to the state governor and In the university president. The Con­gress also petitioned California Governor Pat Brown for clemency in the widely publicized case of Caryl Chessman. Michael Josselson had powerful friends who agreed with him that America had to be self-critical in its struggle against Communism. 

  On the NSA, "The CIA rarely intervened in NSA's debates over political issues, participating only on the margins when Agency officers feared the Association could split apart in political disputes or fall into the hands of extremists (of either the left or the right) who would fritter away the goodwill and influence that NSA had painstakingly acquired among foreign student leaders. Over the years CIA case officers contended with three major developments that threatened the political balance that NSA tried to maintain: the civil rights struggle, the rise of conservatism as a political movement, and the Vietnam War. In the end, "Thus OPC applied itself to the task of subsidizing and assisting the activities of these people, hoping they might gain influence and followings in their respective circles. No coercion was involved or necessary; OPC simply ensured that funds would be available to finance certain forms of anti-Communist activism and organizing by the right sorts of Americans."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/h-m_20230806)</sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/static/4b453cae3b528c19248e6a4cf4a65616/origins-congress-cultural-freedom.pdf)</sup>

- In 1942, after the devastating attack on Pearl Harbour, the US evacuated, from the West Coast, individuals of Japanese descent to temporary assembly centers. This was based on, at the time, military necessity as intelligence was indicating the existence of hundreds of Japanese organizations in California, Washington, Oregon and Arizona which, prior to December 7, 1941, were actively engaged in advancing Japanese war aims. These records also disclosed that thousands of American-born Japanese had gone to Japan to receive their education and indoctrination there and had become pro-Japanese and then had returned to the United States. That's the context for this decision. It has been rightly criticised if going to such lengths were indeed militarily necessary. However, a number of myths persist to this day, to suggest the US lacked care for Japanese people during planning, evacuation and at the new locations. This couldn't be further from the truth. Operations were designed to mitigate impact to their lives—such as sustainment and protection of property, farmland and more.

  As an initial step in the facilitation of voluntary emigration, 48 Wartime Civil Control Administration offices were established, one in each important center of Japanese population in the affected area. These offices were staffed by representatives of the cooperating Federal agencies which had agreed to undertake certain specific responsiblities in the program. The Federal Reserve Bank and the Farm Security Administration had undertaken to provide property protection, under the direction of the Wartime Civil Control Administration—the former, primarily as to business and personal property; the latter primarily respecting agricultural property. The Federal Security Agency, through its various associated agencies, had agreed to provide necessary social services. The 48 Wartime Civil Control Administration offices (which became known as "Wartime Civil Control Administration Service Centers”) were staffed by a team with one or more representatives from each of these agencies. Through every available public information channel prospective evacuees were urged to prepare for evacuation, and to go to these offices for assistance in the solution of their personal problems* It was stated that they would receive aid in their actual migration to the interior. These offices were empowered—among other things—to pay the cost of transportation of evacuees to points in the interior. They undertook to locate specific employment opportunities for prospective evacuees.

  This program met with measurable success in that approximately 9,000 persons of Japanese ancestry voluntarily emigrated from Military Area No. 1 to interior points. However, the attitude of the interior states was hostile. This group considered too dangerous to remain on the West Coast, was similarly regarded by State and local authorities, and by the population of the interior. The evacuees were not welcome. Incidents developed with increasing in¬ tensity, with the result that the Assistant Chief of Staff for Civil Affairs, on March 21, recommended to the Commanding General that evacuation be placed on the basis of complete Federal supervision and control. By Proclamation No. 4, dated March 27, 1942, all persons of Japanese ancestry were required to remain within Military Area No. 1 and were not permitted to change their places of residence.

  Essentially, military necessity required only that the Japanese population be removed from the coastal area and dispersed in the interior, where the danger of action in concert during any attempted enemy raids along the coast, or in advance thereof as preparation for a full scale attack, would be eliminated. That the evacuation program necessarily and ultimately developed into one of complete Federal supervision, was due primarily to the fact that the interior states would not accept an uncontrolled Japanese migration. Although the initial recommendation of February 14, 1942  contemplated the internment of alien Japanese, this was abandoned as a method of operation. Once authority had been granted to set the program in motion, the Commanding General encouraged and facilitated a voluntary exodus with free choice of destination in the interior of persons of Japanese ancestry. Voluntary evacuation was Phase I of the program. Through the Federal Security Agency initially and, after March 12, 1942, when the Wartime Civil Control Administration was established, in cooperation with the other participating Federal agencies, the means were provided for assisting Japanese in undertaking a free exodus from the West Coast. At the request of the Director, Wartime Civil Control Administration, the Federal Reserve Bank also undertook responsibility for the storage of evacuee household goods. This included the acquisition of suitable warehouses, the employment of guards, and the installation of suitable means and methods to ensure a control and inventory of the stored property. Any type of personal property was accepted for storage, including business property and automobiles. Farm implements were warehoused, through the Farm Security Administration’s organization. As for automobiles and trucks, the Army offered to purchase any automobile or truck at Blue Book value, through the Federal Reserve Bank, if an evacuee desired to sell. Evacuee response to the property protection services was most gratifying, and clearly indicated their effectiveness.

   As already noted, the associated agencies of the Federal Security Agency accepted responsibility for providing all necessary social and public health services. These allied agencies included the United States Employment Service, the Bureau of Public Assistance, Social Security Board, and the United States Public Health Service. Among the manifold services provided by these agencies, the United States Public Health Service undertook to examine each evacuee for contagious diseases prior to his entry into an Assembly Center. It also undertook the acquisition of infirmary and hospital equipment, and medical supplies for Assembly Centers, and to make suitable auxiliary arrangements for hospitalization of evacuees in private and public hospitals adjacent to Assembly Centers. Further, it supervised the entire medical program within the Centers.

  The general plan for the evacuation and relocation of Japanese from the West Coast developed rapidly after the authority was granted for the decision that an evacuation of the Japanese population from coastal areas was a military necessity. The mission was clear cut: To devise and operate an evacuation and temporary settlement plan which would remove substantial numbers of people from strategic areas rapidly and safely, and with as little disturbance and loss as practicable to the evacuees and the coastal communities.No precedents existed in American life. European precedents were unsatisfactory for many reasons. Therefore, the Army was faced with the problem of designing a new type of civilian evacuation which would accomplish the mission in a truly American way.

  Several very fundamental decisions were made at the outset of the program which were to guide the evacuation along quite different lines than had been followed in the military evacuation of areas in European countries: First, it was determined that the areas to be evacuated would be handled so far as possible in the order of their relative military importance.  Second, it was determined that the evacuation would not split family units or communities where this could be avoided. In certain foreign countries the evacua¬ tion of a civilian population had proceeded as follows: First, dangerous adult males and females—those suspected of subversive activities—were removed to intern¬ ment camps; and second, all other males of military age were sent to special labor camps. Women and children were often separated from the remainder of the family. This method removes the normal economic support of the family and forces it to dissipate its resources. This in turn creates a community problem of dependency, and disrupts the entire organization of the family.

  Of only slightly less significance than the decision to evacuate entire family units, was the decision to move communities together so far as this was possible under the pressure of the program. Thus, the Japanese of Seattle were all sent to the Puyallup Assembly Center and later to the Minidoka Relocation Center; those from the San Francisco-Oakland Area were temporarily placed in Tanforan and later moved to Central Utah, etc. The basic principle of maintaining communities was adopted to maintain a natural community and economic balance and to preserve desirable institutions by moving each family with its relatives and friends. Third, it was determined that the program should entail a minimum of financial loss to the evacuees; that all possible advice and assistance be available to (but not forced upon) evacuees. It was desired that the evacuated population not only be removed to areas outside of the critical military area as rapidly as practicable, but also to locations where the evacuees could be relatively self-supporting for the duration.<sup>[[1]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3427811&view=2up&seq=16&skin=2021&size=125)</sup></sup> Exceptional, adequate medical and sanitation care was provided during transfer, and at relocation facilities.<sup>[[2]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3427811&view=2up&seq=223&skin=2021)</sup></sup> Of course, Japanese citizens also joined the US military to join the war effort to fight the Japanese imperialism.

- It has been alleged that the CIA, from 1948 onwards, had an operation called, "mockingbird" as an operation to manipulate media domestically. This is a hoax. As confirmed in the CIA's 'Family Jewels'. Mockingbird was just a wiretap on two journalists for 4 months, as they were suspected of making public classified information. "During the period from 12 March 1963 to 15 June 1963, this office installed telephone taps on two Washington-based newsmen who were suspected of disclosing classified information..."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101104822/https://www.cia.gov/open/Family%20Jewels.pdf)</sup></sup> This activity was also lawful at the time, and would be today.<sup>[[2]](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ilj)</sup></sup> Some people, however, have confused and allege that the Church Committee report confirmed this domestic influence operation was real. It did not. It discusses CIA's relationship with about 50 US individuals in media, to collect foreign intelligence, as well as creation of articles to be used at foreign populations, not the US. "They are part of a network of several hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to influence foreign opinion through the use of covert propaganda. These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of foreign newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets. The CIA has been particularly sensitive to the charge that CIA covert relationships with the American media jeopardise the credibility of the American press and risk the possibility  of  propagandising the U.S. public. Former Director William Colby expressed  this concern: 'We have taken particular caution to ensure that our operations are focused abroad and not at the United States in order to influence the opinion of the American people about  things from a CIA point of view.'"<sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/finalreportofsel01unit/page/192/mode/2up)</sup></sup>
