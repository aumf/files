# US Human research, 1932-1990
[The Bullshit asymmetry principle, or Brandolini's law](https://www.nature.com/articles/540171a):
> The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.

A number of myths persist to this day, on a wide-range of Federal, State, and local government activities in human research, from WW2, to the Cold War—this is due to highly inaccurate, sensationalist headlines. Ranging from Biological, Chemical and radiation research—through the Military, CIA, and civilian institutions. Overall, the scientific consensus has been that all these experiments have been safe, in the short and long-term. Informed consent was provided in the vast majority of cases, with only a few unknowns. Nor was research conducted haphazardly, or with little regard for safety or ethics.

#### US Military 
##### BW
Between 1941 and 1969, when President Nixon banned Biological Weapons (BW), the US Army conducted a series of investigations into the defense against BW, and limited use of BW in retaliation. Open-air tests were not human research experiments, contrary to sensationalist speculation, and Soviet disinfo.

- In 1941, just before Pearl Harbor, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson requested a full review of biological warfare (BW) threats. By February 1942, a National Academy of Sciences committee confirmed that BW was “feasible” and urged action. President Roosevelt responded by approving the War Reserve Service (WRS) in August 1942 to develop U.S. defenses. Its major achievement was launching a broad R&D program to “extend the paucity of knowledge about BW.” In November, WRS tasked the Army’s Chemical Warfare Service with scaling up operations, including building labs and pilot plants, marking a key step in protecting the U.S. from this emerging threat. As WWII progressed, concerns heightened. In 1943, the OSS warned of possible German BW plans, prompting the program’s transfer to the War Department in 1944. The Chemical Warfare Service was made responsible for BW agents, defense, and intelligence. Secretary Stimson appointed Mr. George Merck as special consultant and later chair of the United States BW Committee. The U.S. BW policy was firmly defensive, mirroring its chemical warfare stance: “retaliation only.” Though the U.S. had not ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol, President Roosevelt publicly reaffirmed this position in 1942. By war’s end, extensive research had been conducted on BW agents targeting humans, animals, and crops. The U.S. military prioritized safety, with “extreme care taken to protect the participating personnel from infection.” According to a 1946 War Department release, only 60 infections occurred from accidental exposure, with “fifty-two... recovered completely” and the rest recovering. Out of 159 accidental exposures, “all but one... did not develop any infection.” These results reflect the military’s responsible, science-led approach to a complex and dangerous field during wartime.

  In 1948, the U.S. military took proactive steps to address the growing threat of biological warfare (BW) sabotage. A "Report on Special BW Operations" by the Committee on BW warned that “BW was well adapted to subversive use” and that the U.S. was “particularly susceptible” to such attacks. The report emphasized the “grave danger” posed by BW and called for a more robust R&D program. One proposed defensive strategy was testing infrastructure vulnerabilities using harmless organisms in ventilating systems, subways, and water supplies. These recommendations laid the foundation for open-air vulnerability tests and covert research programs, which were approved and led to the creation of the Special Operations Division at Camp Detrick in 1949. Following WWII, BW testing in the U.S. was carefully controlled and science-driven. While many test sites were shut down, Camp Detrick continued limited research focused on safety and defense. Importantly, “no control experimentation on humans had yet been conducted”—despite such practices being standard in vaccine development. Instead, the Army used simulants such as BG and Serratia marcescens (SM), both described by experts as “totally harmless.” These tests were essential for evaluating defensive strategies and improving protective measures for both military and civilian populations. In 1949, the U.S. constructed the world's largest enclosed test sphere at Fort Detrick, showcasing its commitment to scientific advancement in defense. By 1950, open-air sea trials began using simulant clouds to test ship vulnerability and electronic detection systems. These harmless substances were also used in various urban and coastal locations, including San Francisco, New York, and Washington, D.C., under names like Project SHAD, Sea-Spray, and Operation Dew. These efforts reflected the U.S. military's forward-thinking, research-based approach to safeguarding the nation from potential BW threats, whilst balancing concerns for safety of volunteers and the population.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/us-army-bw-activity)</sup></sup>

  "Operation Whitecoat" was the name for the plan to use human volunteers in field experiments concerning the effects of certain biological pathogens upon humans. Thorough legal investigation and ethical review yielded a group of conditions under which volunteers could be used in research: Voluntary consent is required. Written consent must be witnessed, and signed by the individual concerned. No experimentation which could predictably lead to death or permanent disabling injury will be investigated with the use of human volunteers. Proper medical supervision and treatment capability will be immediately available to the subjects. Experimentation must be expected to yield fruitful results for the good of society, not available by other means. Experimentation should avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering. The degree of risk taken should never exceed the importance of the experiment or the expectable benefits from it. The volunteer may remove himself from the experiment at any stage if he feels that he has reached the limits of his physical or mental endurance. The above elements were incorporated in the policies and procedures for the use of human volunteers in biological warfare research published by the Army Chief of Staff (CS 385-30, June 1952). Assignment to Fort Detrick did not mean that the volunteer automatically participated in human experimentation. There was a distinct process used for each experiment. Each medical investigator prepared a protocol that was extensively reviewed and modified to comply with the twelve ethical principles of the Nuremberg Code. (The Nuremberg war crimes trials convicted 23 Nazi doctors of murder). In 1946, Andrew Ivey released his list of ten conditions required for "permissible medical experiments" in healthy subjects, which became known as the Nuremberg Code. These twelve conditions are embodied in the Wilson Memorandum described above.) When a review validated the ethical requirement and scientific validity of an experiment, it was forwarded to Army officials for approval. It was at this point that potential volunteers were briefed as a group on the approved protocol. During this briefing, they became familiar with the purpose of the study and the risks and benefits involved. They also attended an interview with a scientist where they could ask questions about the research. Volunteers were encouraged to discuss the study with family members, clergy and personal physicians. After an obligatory waiting period of 24 hours to four weeks (the length depended on the presumed risks of the study), informed consent documents would be signed. It must be stressed that Operation Whitecoat soldiers were not required to participate in any study, only to be present for the protocol briefings by principal investigators seeking volunteers. About 20 percent of Operation Whitecoat volunteers did not participate in any study during their tenure at Fort Detrick.<sup>[[2]](https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Frequently-Asked-Questions/Human-Subject-Research-at-Fort-Detrick)</sup></sup>

  Several news papers claimed there had been death or serious illness in San Francisco, even a study claimed there might have been a link at a SF and Stanford hospitals. However, close scrutiny of that paper shows serious flaws. Indeed, a seperate review by a group of eminent scientists to review the available information and provide recommendations on the future use of SM. The four reviewers were from CDC, USPHS; Department of Health, City of New York, Ohio State University; and Microbiological Institutes, National Institutes of Health, USPHS. "The data in the referenced article describing the experience in San Francisco are incomplete as to the primary relation of the SM isolated from the patients and their illnesses, except in the case of one patient who died from bacterial endocarditis and SM bacteremia. With this single exception, the finding of SM in these cases was not shown to have influenced the clinical course of the patients' illnesses." Health data for Monroe County (Key West) and Bay County (Panama City) do not support the Newsday allegations of pneumonia cases according to Dr. C. Prather, Florida's Health Officer, as given to the National Observer Weekend Edition (26 December 1976). A state-wide influenza epidemic hit Florida in 1952 and 1953 with a corresponding increase in pneumonia. According to Dr. Prather, the incidence of pneumonia in Bay County (Panama City) was relatively constant in 1951, 1952, and 1953. Additionally, SM has been used medically as a bacterial tracer from 1937 to 1969 with the results having been published in highly reputable medical journals as late as February 1969. Dr. David J. Sencer, Assistant Surgeon General, Center for Division Control in Atlanta GA provides additional data regarding the incidence of pneumonia and influenza deaths near cities where the vulnerability tests were conducted. The report substantiates the lack of evidence associating the reported deaths with the organisms used in the various tests.<sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/us-army-bw-activity/page/141/mode/2up)</sup></sup>

  Dorset Biological Warfare Experiments, also known as DICE trials. Professor Brian G. Spratt, Centre for the Epidemiology of Infectious Disease, University of Oxford, along with several leading experts conducted an independent review of the health effects of the Dorset trials, and found, "The majority of the health concerns that were raised by members of the public were of a general nature - chronic ill health since living in the area of the bacterial releases - or were miscarriages, learning disabilities or, in a few cases, birth defects. The senior Medical Microbiologists that I consulted were unanimous and vigorous in their view that these sorts of health problems are not caused by any of the bacteria that were released in the Dorset Defence Trials."<sup>[[4]](https://web.archive.org/web/20040112042926/http://www.mod.uk/linked_files/bacteria_trials.pdf)</sup></sup> It must also be noted that the UK CW/BW tests were conducted with the consent and approval of local authorities, such as the Norwich local Police and London Transport Board, contrary to some conspiracy theorist claims.<sup>[[5]](https://web.archive.org/web/20090920163730/http://www.nr23.net/govt/images/pdf/DOC%20Secretary%20of%20State%20Briefing%20Memo%20%20Public%20Area%20CW%20%20BW%20Experiments%20May%201963.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://web.archive.org/web/20130515124012/http://www.nr23.net/govt/images/pdf/DOC%20Porton%20Field%20Trial%20Report%20No%20610%20The%20Penetration%20Of%20Built%20Up.pdf#page=8)</sup></sup>



##### CW
- The U.S. Army’s use of human volunteers in chemical research was grounded in strict ethical, legal, and medical standards. A 1976 Army Inspector General report affirmed that “the absolute essentiality of voluntary consent has been the stated policy” of both the Department of Defense and the Army since research authority began. This policy, formalized by Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson after World War II, echoed the Nuremberg Code and emphasized that consent must be informed, free from “force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion.” Each researcher held a “personal duty and responsibility” to ensure informed consent—non-delegable and taken seriously across all levels. The report concluded confidently: “All available evidence indicated that only volunteer subjects were used,” and that nearly all signed formal agreements. Importantly, there was “no evidence” that any subject was ever exposed to high risk for the sake of scientific gain. From a safety and moral standpoint, the Army required extensive laboratory work before human testing was ever permitted. According to Chief of Staff Memorandum 385, all experiments had to “yield fruitful results for the good of society,” and must be justified by prior animal testing and scientific evidence. The memorandum stressed minimizing the number of human subjects and preventing “all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.” Experiments that risked death or permanent harm were strictly prohibited, and safety procedures and trained personnel were mandatory. The IG report praised the Army's dedication, noting that scientists engaged in “a great deal of painstaking research” over many years to comply with these high ethical standards before involving human volunteers.

  Chemical compounds considered for testing were not selected randomly but emerged from a rigorous, methodical process. Substances came from industry, scientific literature, and military discovery, with the most significant source being the Chemical Corps Industrial Liaison Program. Compounds like benzilates (BZ) were screened for potential use as irritants, incapacitants, or lethal agents. From 1950 to 1975, around 34,500 chemicals were evaluated. Only 2,077 passed initial screening, and following detailed studies, just 51 were approved for pre-clinical medical testing. This process shows a clear moral and scientific commitment to only advancing substances with potential defensive utility and acceptable safety profiles. Of the 51 pre-clinical candidates, only 32 ultimately progressed to human volunteer trials—further evidence of the Army’s caution and prioritization of safety. These agents underwent extensive testing, including pathology, pharmacology, therapy, and prophylaxis studies in animals before ever reaching a human subject. Only after passing every pre-clinical benchmark were they deemed safe for volunteers. This strict multi-phase review ensured that the “degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance” of the research goal. Overall, the U.S. military’s BW and chemical research program, especially regarding human subjects, was marked by high ethical standards, robust oversight, and a clear moral imperative to protect participants while defending the nation.

  A request to conduct experiments with nerve gases on volunteers was submitted in August 1953. Permission was granted in November 1953, however, it did not provide for a source of volunteer subjects. On 12 March 1954 The Surgeon General prepared a set of principles, policies, and rules for the use of human volunteers in medical research. With four exceptions, these principles generally were the same as those published in Chief of Staff memorandum 385. The first rule was in the form of expanded guidance regarding volunteer consent. Next, rules 7 and 8 of the Chief of Staff memorandum 358 guidance were expanded as follows: "Adequate preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death. This included hospitalization and medical treatment as may be required. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons (including an adequately trained physician) who shall be required to exercise the highest degree of skill and care throughout the experiment. Competent consultants should be available on short notice in this connection." Finally, there was included an additional rule: "Agents used in research must have the following limiting characteristics: controllable lethality; no serious chronicity anticipated; effective therapy available; and adequate background or animal experimentations." These were not intended to replace the rules set forth in the basic policy, but rather to clarify their intent. This program reportedly visualized four types of studies for human volunteers. "The first category consists of planned, hazardous experiments where there is a clear-cut risk, but with intelligent, adequate supervision, safeguards, and adequate therapy available, it is felt that no irrevocable damage will be done. Experiments will not be attempted where such damage can be foreseen. These form the type of experiments for which the Army Secretary's approval has been received and the only kind where such approval is required. Another category includes risk of accidental exposure to hazardous degree. The fullest possible studies should be made of any such unplanned exposures. The third category consists of experiments that are only potentially but not definitely hazardous. These experiments would be hazardous if the individual, despite previous examinations and check-up, should prove unusually senstitive, or if there occurs an accidental error or break in technique. The fourth category of procedures will be those designated non-hazardous, experiments involving no hazard greater than that of crossing a highway."
  
  Pennsylvania’s Holmesburg prison. An investigation found that Dr. Albert Kligman complied with DoD policy on human volunteers that required, among other things, consent. It was also the only experiment conducted on inmates.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/army-igchem)</sup></sup> Another review found, "It appears that all of the test subjects were volunteers and that stringent medical safeguards and followup procedures were used."<sup>[[2]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/NCB/02-A-0846_RELEASE.pdf#page=5)</sup></sup> Evidence that more than 7,000 volunteers were tested at Edgewood Arsenal without a single fatality or serious injury must be accepted as supporting evidence of the ability of the US Army and the medical research staff to fulfill their responsibilities.<sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/army-igchem)</sup></sup> In the spring of 1980, the Department of the Army asked the Committee on Toxicology of the National Research Council's Board on Toxicology and Environmental Health Hazards to study the possible chronic or delayed adverse health effects incurred by servicemen who had been exposed experimentally to various chemicals at the U.S. Army Laboratories, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Edgewood, Maryland, during 1955-1975. Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a three-volume study, which found no adverse health effects from those subjects.<sup>[[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222994/)</sup></sup> Project SHAD was under Project 112. They ran both chemical and biological tests. To date, there is no clear evidence of specific, long-term health problems associated with participation in Project SHAD. The Health and Medicine Division (formally known as the Institute of Medicine) of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducted a study sponsored by VA and presented findings in the 2007 report Long-Term Health Effects of Participation in Project SHAD (Shipboard Hazard and Defense). The same conclusions were found in a 2016 Report, Assessing Health Outcomes Among Veterans of Project SHAD (Shipboard Hazard and Defense).<sup>[[5]](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11900/long-term-health-effects-of-participation-in-project-shad-shipboard-hazard-and-defense)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21846/assessing-health-outcomes-among-veterans-of-project-shad-shipboard-hazard-and-defense)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/shad/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/edgewood-aberdeen/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/shad/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Environmental-Exposures/Chemical-and-Biological-Exposures)</sup></sup>
  
- Among the first chemicals used as lethal/tactical weapons during World War I (WW I) were vesicants or blistering agents. The most widely used agents were the mustards, also known as mustard gas. Fearful that mustard gas might be used again in WW II, the U.S. military conducted experiments at the beginning of the war to test the effectiveness of various protective clothing and equipment in preventing injury/incapacitation due to mustard gas exposure (2). One method of testing involved exposing Navy volunteers wearing protective clothing and gas masks to mustard gas in a sealed chamber that was 10′ by 15′ with a 12′ high ceiling. The interiors of the chambers were most often maintained at 90°F and 65% relative humidity to test the durability of protective clothing under tropical conditions. Chamber test participants were often ask to perform routine duties, (e.g., marching), to determine the degree they had been incapacitated by their exposure to mustard gas. A study published in 2000, at the recommendation of NRC, found, "To date there have been no studies examining possible long-term adverse health effects among test participants who received low level non-lethal exposures of mustard gas. We conducted a mortality follow-up study comparing the cause specific mortality of exposed veterans (i.e., veterans who participated in chamber tests) to that of controls (i.e., veterans who served during the same time period but who had no evidence of mustard gas exposure). All veterans in this study were white males. This study assessed the risk of cause-specific mortality associated with mustard gas exposure among Navy chamber test participants. Assessing the relative risk of cause specific mortality, namely respiratory diseases and respiratory cancers, there was no increased risk of any cause of death associated with mustard gas exposure. There was also no increased risk in cause specific mortality associate with level of mustard gas exposure among exposed veterans."<sup>[[11]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1047279700000600)</sup></sup>

- Chemical releases. (Fluorescent particles, ZnCdS), in the public domain, such as St Louis, Minneapolis. Despite claims made by Lisa Martino-Taylor in her dissertation—a critical examination of declassified documents she cites, reveals no evidence of a hidden program of radioactive tests in St. Louis and Minneapolis. Nor do they reveal any coverup or secrecy or "poisoned" residents, between 1953 and 1965. To quote from the material she references, "Meetings were held with various city officials of St. Louis for the purpose of completing arrangements for wiresonde and field-test operations. Minor difficulties with the Park Commissioner were ironed out with the completion of the change in city administration. The St. Louis police department was quite cooperative at all times, and the fire department aided in the recovery of a kytoon and thermistor which had become entangled in a tree during gusty winds. Civil Defence and city officials of Winnipeg and surrounding municipalities were exceptionally cooperative in helping to initiate mesometeorological operations in that city. As a result, considerable interest was shown by the press and the public. Nor did these studies target minorities. Indeed, the opposite is true, "Those residents in the How Area contacted for location of sampling equipment in homes were found to be extremely cooperative."<sup>[[12]](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0031508.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[13]](https://archive.org/details/Aerosol-study)</sup></sup> <sup>[[14]](https://archive.org/details/st-louis-dispersion-study)</sup></sup> The aerosols that were released were all safe. The US Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventative Medicine conducted health risk assessments of these Cold War era tests in 1994 following the declassification of the test reports. These health risk assessments used guidance from the EPA and focused on determining the health effects from inhalation exposure to the ZnCdS, which was used to simulate potential Soviet deployed biological agents from that era. These health risk assessments determined that exposure to ZnCds from the testing would not cause a health risk to those exposed. The National Research Council Committee on Toxicology, a private nonprofit institution, conducted an independent review of the health risk assessments. In their report, Completed in 1997, the NRC agreed with the Army's conclusion that ZnCdS exposures would not cause a health risk, finding, "tests did not expose residents of the United States and Canada to chemical levels considered harmful."<sup>[[15]](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/5739/toxicologic-assessment-of-the-armys-zinc-cadmium-sulfide-dispersion-tests)</sup></sup> In addition, they recommended that the Army conduct a subsequent toxicological study to determine the effects of ZnCds when it broke down in the body.

  The U.S. Army followed the National Research Council's recommendations and completed a toxicological study in 1998. The toxicological study found that more than 40% of the ZnCdS was cleared from the test subjects within the first day, only a very small amount was found after one week, and the remaining amount was negligible after 14 weeks following exposure. Additionally, it found evidence that ZnCdS does not likely break down into Cadmium in the body. While a single very high concentration could elicit an inflammatory response in the lungs that diminished with time, this dosage was 8,409 times the amount that was used in the Army ZnCdS dispersion testing. This study was peer reviewed and published in Inhalation Toxicology, Volume 12 in 2000. The National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine conducted an independent review of the toxicity study in 2004 and corroborated the conclusions presented in the National Research Council assessment and the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine toxicological study. The U.S. Army Public Health Command has reviewed the health risk assessments as well as available source documents from the NRC's Committee on Toxicology and the Institute of Medicine. The U.S. Army Public Health Command reconfirms that exposure to ZCdS, under the test conditions reported, would not cause a health risk in humans. Further, these reports contain no evidence of a radioactive component to the ZnCdS dispersion testing as has been alleged in the media.<sup>[[16]](https://web.archive.org/web/20121109112920/http://www.blunt.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/430b5197-ca1d-4b06-bcc5-c8d7f9d7cf92/Response%20from%20Army.pdf)</sup></sup> Indeed, several independent studies were conducted by the UK's Academy of Medical Sciences, and others, finding that ZnCdS, CdS and Cd is also safe—as these were also used by the MoD's dispersion tests, (Dorset Biological Warfare Experiments, also known as DICE trials) "With regard to the land-based trials it is concluded that the dissemination of ZnCdS by the UK during the ‘Cold War’ did not significantly add to the cadmium concentrations in soil, except within a few metres of the point of dissemination of the material. Except immediately around the dispersal sites in two trials at RAF Beaulieu airfield, the predicted soil concentrations are within the range of cadmium concentrations normally observed in the UK and much lower than those found at Shipham. Risk to the public from soil contamination with cadmium from these and other ZnCdS dispersion trials is therefore considered to be negligible. With regard to the long-range contamination trials, the dose potentially received by inhalation during even the most severe case was small (c. 0.13 μg Cd). Over all the trials, our worst case estimate of personal dose received from these trials is c. 10 μg over an eight year period. This is the amount of cadmium that is inhaled in a normal urban environment in a period of between 12 and 100 days. We are also reassured by the fact that no increased incidence has been claimed for the diseases that are particularly associated with cadmium toxicity. We were further reassured by discovering that the people largely involved in the dissemination of the cadmium sulphide from aircraft who will have been exposed to very much larger amounts than anybody on the ground suffered no ill effects. Our conclusions therefore do mirror those in the much more comprehensive American study."<sup>[[17]](https://acmedsci.ac.uk/file-download/34958-ZincCadm.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[18]](https://oem.bmj.com/content/59/1/13)</sup></sup> <sup>[[19]](https://archive.org/details/uk-bw-defence-field-trials-1940-1979)</sup></sup>

##### Radiation
- After WW2, the United States DoD conducted experiments with radiation on human subjects. An independent review that examined studies and policy from 1944 to 1994 found: Fully informed consent was an essential requirement for human subjects, as well as adequate medical treatment and strict ethics guidance adhered to. For example, conspiracy theorists have claimed that the DoD and University of Cincinnati conducted unethical experiments "on more than 90 poor, black, advanced stage cancer patients with inoperable tumors" and that Dr. Eugene Saenger "forged consent forms, and did not inform the patients of the risks of irradiation." However, this couldn't be further from the truth. The research at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine (UCCM) examined the effectiveness of using new, deep-penetrating TBI technology to improve the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. During the 1950s and 1960s, the DoD sought information on the biological and clinical features of radiation injury. The DoD funded laboratory studies and psychological tests of cancer patients after they had received TBI and PBI as treatment for their disease. The DoD’s initial objective was to obtain a biological marker of radiation exposure. After 1965, the DoD was also interested in obtaining data on the psychological response to radiation exposure. A total of 88 patients from Cincinnati General Hospital participated in this project. Patient selection criteria required that only individuals with proven metastatic or far-advanced cancer be selected for the studies. In addition, subjects had to be in relatively good nutritional status and, in most cases, have normal hematologic values. These criteria remained relatively constant throughout the twelve years of the study. UCCM researchers also sought patients who had not undergone previous radiation or chemotherapy, had normal kidney function and new, abnormal tissue growth that was not radiosensitive, and were without lymphoma or bronchogenic cancer. According to a 1972 University of Cincinnati review of the project, the demographic distribution of study participants reflected the patient population of the Cincinnati General Hospital.
  
  In January 1972, the American College of Radiology (ACR) reviewed the science, methodology, and design of the project from a medical point of view to determine if the project conformed to then-contemporary standards for clinical investigations. The ACR report concluded that the UCCM project was validly conceived, stated, executed, controlled, and followed up; the process of patient selection conformed with sound medical practice; and procedures for obtaining patient consent were valid, thorough, and consistent with National Institutes of Health recommendations and the practices of most cancer centers. Also in November 1971, Clifford Grulee, M.D., Dean of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, appointed an Ad Hoc Committee made up of members of the UCCM faculty to review the project. Dr. Grulee asked the committee to review the project’s scientific content, methodology, and data treatment. The committee’s report, released in January 1972, indicated that there were no problems with the project’s scientific content or methodology. In addition, the committee stated that there was no evidence that DASA funding was made contingent on work, ideas, or suggestions proposed by DASA and all information reported to DASA was kept unclassified and publicly available.<sup>[[23]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210821164345/https://archive.defense.gov/pubs/dodhre/Narratv.pdf)</sup></sup> From 1963 to 1973, a leading endocrinologist, Dr. Carl Heller, studied radiation's affects male reproductive function. ACHRE, "we calculated that it would take more than double the dose received by any prisoner-subject to yield an effective dose of 1 rem. This means that the predicted increase over the expected cancer rate for the individuals who received the greatest exposure would be less that four-hundreths of 1 percent. For those who received smaller doses of radiation, the risk would, of course, be smaller, too.<sup>[[24]](https://ehss.energy.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap9_2.html)</sup></sup>
  
- Some conspiracy theorists cite, what they believe as evidence, that the government covered-up evidence of the dangers posed to communities while conducting nuclear tests, in general—is a August 1980 subcommittee report on low-level radiation exposure. They quote the passage, "In addition, the government's program for monitoring the health effects of the tests was in-adequate and, more disturbingly all evidence suggesting that radiation was having harmful effects, be it on the sheep or the people, was not only disregarded but actually suppressed." However, a careful reading of this report shows that the only item they believe was "covered-up" and "suppressed" was a specific incident involving the deaths of sheep in Utah and Nevada. This incident only related to the Upshot-Knothole Test Series. A critical reading doesn't support the subcommittee's report. The matter was settled by a consensus in scientific literature, and also in Court, in 1956. The judge presiding over the case was A. Sherman Christensen. The government’s defense (backed by expert witnesses and unclassified records) maintained that fallout levels from the Upshot-Knothole Test Series were too low to cause the sheep deaths, and that the timing between the atomic tests and subsequent sheep deaths was purely a coincidence. Judge Christensen sided with the expert testimony provided by the AEC, stating that the government was negligent in not warning sheep owners of potential fallout in the area, but nothing more. A few years later, he overturned this ruling based on the aforementioned report. However, this ruling was in turn, over-ruled by a 3-Judge panel. "The trial court thus (1) mentioned the Bustad report and asserted that information had been withheld; (2) it mentioned that the Government had given misleading information as to radiation dosages; (3) that the veterinarians had been pressured by the Government; and (4) that misleading answers had been given to interrogatories by the Government. Each of these specifics have been considered in relation to the record in the proceedings appealed from and to what original record and briefs are extant. We must conclude that none of these several findings or conclusions are supported by the record. The information, data, reports, maps, experiments and witnesses were all available to plaintiffs at the first trial. The data is the same now. They tried their case on the basis of their then best judgment in the selection of witnesses, interviews, the evaluation of data and reports, and the consideration of the position of the experts.

  We have not mentioned the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory comparative study of radiation burns (in experiments) and the lesions on the Utah sheep. The analysis of tissues, organs, bones and blood samples made by Doctors Comar, Rust and Trum showed no evidence of radiation injury to the sheep in the flocks of plaintiffs where the losses took place. A tissue analysis was made on the sheep by the Utah University College of Medicine and the conclusion was reached that the sheep had been exposed to radiation but the examination concluded that there had been no acute effects from the exposure. The Hanford comparative study, as mentioned, concluded that the sheep had not died from exposure to radiation. In Bulloch I the conclusion of the experts was that the sheep and lambs had died as a result of unprecedented cold weather during the lambing and shearing, together with malnutrition, also to generally poor range conditions and to common diseases which caused the skin lesions and deaths. These conditions were established by the evidence. The losses began after an initial detonation but before the detonation of the "Harry" test. The expert witnesses who were the leading authorities on the subject thus concluded that the losses were not due to radiation. There was no evidence presented that humans in the areas with the sheep nor animals such as the sheep dogs or horses, which were with the sheep, were affected. This recent increase in the heat, the light, and awareness of atomic energy is all worthwhile, but we are unable to find in it any reason, as the plaintiffs apparently would have us do, to overturn the considered judgment of the court reached 25 years ago.<sup>[[25]](https://casetext.com/case/bulloch-v-united-states-2)</sup></sup> <sup>[[26]](https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1201913/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[27]](http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat4/150521.pdf)</sup> <sup>[[28]](https://www.energy.gov/management/articles/fehner-and-gosling-atmospheric-nuclear-weapons-testing-1951-1963-battlefield)</sup></sup> A seperate lawsuit rested in 1988, where it was alleged that the Government failed in a duty to warn and provide information. A Federal appeals Court found this not so—while smacking down other claims. "In the instant case, no evidence was presented of any act or omission of the AEC or its employees that clearly contravened a specific statutory or regulatory duty, or that exceeded statutory or regulatory authority.

- In 1954, the US detonated a series of nuclear bombs to study their yield. This was part of Operation Castle and Operation Crossroads, near Bikini Atoll. Due to a miscalculation there was an increase in radiation output than expected. The US Department of Energy estimated that 253 inhabitants of the Marshall Islands were impacted by the radioactive fallout. It is alleged that the US deliberately used the Marshallese as "ginea pigs" for testing radiation under project 4.1. This allegation has been thoroughly investigated and is not supported by any evidence. Operation Castle had no biomedical program. US Military personnel were also exposed to large amounts of radiation, when they thought they were in safe areas of the expected yield.<sup>[[30]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16380885-g1vuWf/16380885.pdf#page=212)</sup></sup> <sup>[[31]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16061854-leUIeE/16061854.pdf#page=5)</sup></sup>

- Operation Plumbbob. Troops were not studied for radiation research, contrary to conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists.
Exercises Desert Rock VII and VIII, the test groups, and AFSWC each developed its own organization and procedures for ensuring the radiological safety of its members based on the established criteria of the AEC. The radiological safety plans were developed to minimize operational exposures to ionizing radiation. Based on exposure limits and mode of delivery, minimum distance criteria for positioning Desert Rock troops and observers were established. For a tower shot with a predicted maximum yield of about 10 kilotons, troops in the open were positioned at least 4,000 yards from ground zero. Troops in trenches at such a shot were positioned no closer than 2,600 yards from ground zero. Troops in armored vehicles were positioned no closer than 2,800 yards from ground zero. Radiation doses have been reconstructed for all of the major troop test units at the operation. These doses are in agreement with the available film badge dosimetry. About 40 DOD personnel received total doses exceeding 5 rem∗ during PLUMBBOB; half of these were accrued by cloud samplers or penetrators. The three largest doses were between 13 and 22 rem to Air Force fliers who penetrated the Shot JOHN cloud at about 10 minutes after burst. The other doses over 5 rem were scattered, mostly among Desert Rock VII and VIII support and technical service project personnel. Very few of the personnel in the major troop test described above received as much as 2 rem. The average total dose to DOD participants at PLUMBBOB was 0.4 rem. Animals were used for medical examination.<sup>[[32]](https://www.dtra.mil/Portals/125/Documents/NTPR/newDocs/14-PLUMBBOB%20-%202021.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[33]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16004390.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[34]](https://www.dtra.mil/Portals/125/Documents/NTPR/newDocs/ANTHReport/1957_DNA_6005F.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[35]](https://ia801305.us.archive.org/17/items/Misc-DoD/Analysis%20of%20Radiation%20Exposure%204th%20Marine%20Corps%20Provisional%20Atomic%20Exercise%20Brigade%2015%20June%201981.pdf)</sup></sup>

  As the ACHRE and DoD reviews found, "no documentation has been identified to indicate that human radiation experiments were part of the U.S. atmospheric nuclear weapons testing program. The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) concluded in 1995 that, 'although there was a real possibility that human subject research had been conducted in conjunction with the bomb tests, the tests were not themselves experiments involving human subjects.' Human aspects research conducted in conjunction with atomic weapons tests was designed to study the effects atomic weapons would have on combat operations. For example, flashblindness studies, troop training and maneuvers, psychological testing, and decontamination studies were designed with the goal of increasing the capabilities and preparedness of military forces to conduct effective military operations on a nuclear battlefield."<sup>[[36]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210821164345/https://archive.defense.gov/pubs/dodhre/Narratv.pdf)</sup></sup> Lastly, it should be noted that the Advisory Committee did find that "for the period 1944 to 1974 there is no evidence that any [US] government statement or policy on research involving human subjects contained a provision permitting a waiver of consent requirements for national security reasons".
  
- Green Run. ACHRE and the GAO found that, "Our work did not document that the test was intended to be a radiation warfare experiment or a field test of radiobiological effects on humans. In particular, we examined still-classified passages in the Green Run test report and found that they did not refer to any such intentions or operations."<sup>[[37]](http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat4/150521.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[38]](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10111991)</sup></sup>  

#### CIA
##### MKULTRA
- There exists a rich universe of misleading allegations of MKULTRA, due to pop culture, historical revisionists and disinformation agents, about MKULTRA. Here are the raw facts: CIA has had a recurring interest in behavioral drugs. The subject is of general interest because of the operational applications that could be made against Agency employees by hostile forces, for which there would be a defensive requirement, as well as for possible use against foreigners to influence their behavior. The earliest record of this interest dates to the post-WWII period when there were indications of Soviet interest in the use of drugs for such purposes, the most famous example being the bizarre confessions of Cardinal Mindszenty in February 1949. In the past, CIA's interest has taken form in 4 programs: Bluebird/artichoke, mkdelta/search.

  Project BLUEBIRD, later renamed ARTICHOKE, began in 1949 as a CIA initiative to protect against foreign use of behavioral drugs and interrogation techniques. According to the text, its original goal was “developing a capability to resist or offset the effect of behavioral drugs,” especially those believed to be under development in the Soviet Bloc. The project sought both defensive and exploratory methods, such as “memory enhancement” and preventing “unauthorized extraction of information, and "establishing defensive means for preventing hostile control of Agency personnel." CIA offices including Scientific Intelligence (OSI) and Medical Services (OMS) collaborated through the informal "ARTICHOKE Committee," reflecting a coordinated inter-office effort in the early Cold War. While LSD became a topic of interest, records show that when OSI proposed LSD testing on Agency volunteers in 1953, “no such experiments were made” under OSI’s direction. The Agency’s behavioral drug research was carried out in collaboration with external experts, including periodic meetings with scientists at Camp Dietrick. A 1953 incident at Deep Creek Lake, where LSD was unknowingly introduced into a drink at a party between Army/Agency personnel, is documented as part of this experimental exploration. Importantly, those involved later agreed “in principle that such a program should be explored,” highlighting the CIA's cautious approach to studying the potential of these substances. The unfortunate death of Dr. Frank Olson following this incident was met with a transparent and responsible response from the CIA. Dr. Olson, a civilian Army employee, had prior psychological instability, and it was “judged that the drug served to trigger the act leading to his death.” The CIA ensured that his family was properly compensated, officially acknowledging that his death occurred under “circumstances arising out of an experiment undertaken in the course of his official duties.” Additionally, the Director of Central Intelligence issued formal reprimands to three CIA employees involved, demonstrating the Agency’s accountability and commitment to oversight, even in highly sensitive and experimental programs conducted in the interest of national defense.

  MKDELTA/SEARCH: On 29 October 1952 a formal policy was established by the Deputy Director of Plans (as then styled, now Deputy Director for Operations) for the use of biochemicals in clandestine operations (mkdelta). This was brought under a special funding procedure established on 3 April 1953 for special research purposes (mkultra). Among the materials studied were psylocbin and LSD. Following laboratory testing a second phase was begun which involved testing on voluntary participants. This research was conducted at well-known institutions under the control and direction of researchers at, and in conformance to the standards of, those institutions. The research and its results were generally unclassified and published in the normal manner by those researchers. In only three instances was research performed in a manner which would raise questions regarding its ethical/moral propriety (the safehouse activities, with the Bureau of Narcotics as the lead) The questionable subprojects involved the use of individuals who were not aware that they were the subjects of a research program or that they were being given a drug. This unwitting testing generally took place in social situations among friends and acquaintances of the researcher.  In 1963, after questions were raised within the Agency by the Inspector General about the propriety of these subprojects, they were discontinued. Responses to inquiries say, "One private researcher writes, with reference to prospective experiments with drugs, "I was told that I would have absolute discretion of refusal and that I would have final authority on experimental design and informed consent: All of this research was open and above board .. Never, never was I asked to do anything which violated medical ethics or the principles of informed consent with reference to the matters of unwitting administration of drugs, psychotropic or other, I can state categorically that no CIA person ever asked me to administer such drugs, wittingly or unwittingly. No such drugs were ever administered by me or under my direction. The people who undertook this investigation were able scientists, and they selected advisors and researchers who seemed to be the individuals most able to contribute... From a long experience with this project, I can say that I never saw a single case of experimental drug administration without informed consent."

  The president of one prominent university wrote: "If I had been at the time individually aware of such a research project and had been called. upon to pass judgment on it, I would have judged it by the merit of the particular project and not by which governmental agency was directly or indirectly sponsoring the research. As far as I am concerned the CIA is just as respectable as any other governmental agency or private foundation ... I wonder whether most of this concern about these research projects arises not out of any ethical considerations but out of hostility in certain circles toward anything done by CIA whether openly or covertly." In sum, if there was any unwitting drug testing sponsored directly by CIA, it seems to have been limited almost exclusively to the safehouse operations. Apart from the activities in the safe-houses we have found for the most part that CIA was interested in the results of research initiated and sponsored by other organizations and conducted in accordance with professional and ethical standards applicable to the circumstances at the time. We have found no evidence that CIA exerted undue influence or attempted in any way to coerce individuals or institutions to undertake research they might not otherwise have undertaken nor did the Agency attempt to cause any compromise of professional and ethical standards under which the research was conducted. Insofar as we are able to tell from our records, none of the research conducted by private institutions was clandestine in any way; studies were carried out openly and the results in many cases were published. As a matter of fact, it can even be reported that some significant contributions were made in the advancement of psychiatry, pharmacology, and medicine."

  Project OFTEN was initiated in 1967 by the CIA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) in collaboration with Edgewood Arsenal Research Laboratories. Its main objective was to explore how drugs could influence human behavior. The program involved laboratory testing, toxicological studies, and animal experiments. Promising compounds were further tested on human volunteers at Edgewood. The project also aimed to synthesize new derivatives based on the structure of these substances to enhance their potential utility. Project CHICKWIT operated alongside OFTEN and focused on acquiring intelligence about new drug developments, particularly from Europe and Asia. It involved collecting samples of novel compounds, including one suspected incapacitating agent believed to be under Soviet research. This substance was seen as a potential threat to U.S. leaders due to the ease with which it could be administered. Testing of this compound was conducted at Edgewood between 1971 and 1972, involving twenty volunteers. These trials were part of a broader effort to understand and possibly counter foreign chemical threats.<sup>[[39]](https://archive.org/details/cia-rdp-86-m-00886-r-000800010039-4)</sup></sup> <sup>[[40]](https://archive.org/details/cia-rd-and-testing-of-be-15132315)</sup></sup> <sup>[[41]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP83-00156R000300050028-0.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[42]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP83-00156R000300050037-0.pdf)</sup></sup>

   
  Conspiracy theorists claim that the CIA conducted radiation experiments on humans, as part of mkultra. However, 3 independent reviews found this was not so. CIA's History Staff conducted the most authoritative investigation onto the matter and found that it had not. This independent finding was corroborated by ACHRE's independent examination, "No evidence was found among the public or classified records to contradict CIA's conclusion that it did not engage in human radiation experiments." And, "Although CIA was a member of the Interagency Working Group on Human Radiation Experiments and possessed documents suggesting CIA involvement with human radiation experimentation, the Advisory Committee has found no evidence to indicate that CIA actually conducted or sponsored such experiments."<sup>[[43]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=660)</sup></sup> <sup>[[44]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=680)</sup></sup> <sup>[[45]](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/27/031/27031227.pdf#page=56)</sup></sup> <sup>[[46]](https://archive.org/details/csi-radiation-review)</sup></sup> <sup>[[47]](https://sgp.fas.org/library/humexp/appb.htm)</sup></sup> Further, no, the US Government didn't invent LSD. It's a surprise, but people do believe this. No, it was discovered by Albert Hofmann, a Swiss chemist, in 1938.<sup>[[48]](https://archive.org/details/army-igchem)</sup></sup> 


##### Civilian

- At the request of New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services, beginning in 2005, the Vera Institute of Justice undertook an in-depth examination of issues related to the enrollment and monitoring of New York City foster children in clinical trials related to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The request was prompted by allegations that African American and Latino children were inappropriately removed from their families and placed in foster care to facilitate their enrollment in dangerous and unnecessary medical experiments. Vera reviewers found little or no evidence in the information examined for some of the concerns that prompted Children’s Services to initiate this study. Many children—inside and outside of foster care and clinical trials—died because of complications of HIV/AIDS during the late 1980s and 1990s. Vera medical staff did not find, however, that any child’s death was caused directly by clinical trial medication. An examination of data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, though not conclusive, suggests that HIV-positive foster children who were enrolled in clinical trials and/or observational research studies did not experience an increased risk of death from their enrollment in clinical trials. There was no evidence in the child welfare files of children being removed from their families by Children’s Services because a parent refused to consent to a child’s participation in a clinical trial. Vera reviewers found no evidence in the child welfare files, clinical trial protocols, or interviews that children, parents, foster parents, foster care agencies or staff, or child welfare agencies or staff received incentive payments for children to participate in clinical trials.<sup>[[49]](http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat4/150521.pdf)</sup></sup>

- From 1945 through 1947 Manhattan Project researchers injected eighteen human subjects with plutonium, five human subjects with polonium, and six human subjects with uranium to obtain metabolic data related to the safety of those working on the production of nuclear weapons. All of these subjects were patients hospitalized at facilities affiliated with the Universities of Rochester (11 patients), California (3 patients), and Chicago (3 patients) or at Oak Ridge (1 patient). Another set of experiments took place between 1953 and 1957 at Massachusetts General Hospital, in which 11 patients with terminal conditions were injected with uranium. All were near death (in a coma or semicoma) prior to injection and were receiving usual hospital care for comatose patients. The subjects expired from their brain cancer within several months of injection. Study results indicated that 99 percent of the injected uranium cleared the blood within 20 hours. This wasn't a government program, so to speak. It was a collection of a few individuals at universities who coordinated on their own. How all the injections were coordinated—or even if they were coordinated—is unclear.<sup>[[50]](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10111991)</sup></sup> 
 
  Further, ACHRE couldn't determine if those involved provided consent, due to obvious limitations. Some did consent, others may not have. As one officer said, "It is unlikely that these tests were made without the consent of the subjects." Which supports a claim made by one of the Chicago doctors in 1974 that some form of oral consent for the injections had been obtained. When the civilian AEC took over for the Manhattan District on January 1, 1947, the plutonium injections provoked a strong reaction at the highest levels. Concern for minimizing risk of harm to subjects is evident in several of the planning documents relating to the experiments, an obligation that many of those involved apparently took seriously. At Chicago, for example, where the highest doses of plutonium were used, care was taken to ensure that all the subjects had terminal illnesses.<sup>[[51]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=255)</sup></sup> A 1962 paper, openly published, said that, "During the early days of the Manhattan Project, the excretion and retention data on which to base a method of diagnosing Pu239 body burden were largely from experiments on rats. It seemed imperative, therefore, to determine retention and excretion in a limited number of terminal human patients. Sixteen cases were studied, the first beginning in April of 1945. Life expectancy of the individual and relative freedom from kidney disease were the principle criteria for case selection. As a rule, individuals were chosen who were past 45 yr of age and who were suffering from well-established disorders that made survival for 10 or more years highly improbable. Adherence to this rule avoided the possibility of development of late radiation effects from plutonium." The study notes that many such patients died within 30 days, due to their terminal illness. Only 3 lived the full 138-day observation period."<sup>[[52]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16369158-b6Yb0H/16369158.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Historical revisionists have long-claimed that the US conducted unethical research on Children with radiation. However, a critical examination of the record reflects this is not so. Although in the 1940s and 1950s there were apparently no written rules of professional ethics for pediatric research in general, there were guidelines for the investigational use of radioisotopes in children. In 1949, the Subcommittee on Human Applications of the Atomic Energy Commission's Isotope Division established a set of rules to judge proposals submitted by researchers for the use of radioisotopes in medical experiments with human subjects, including "normal children."" These standards appeared in the fall 1949 supplement to the AEC's isotope catalogue and price list. These guidelines did not mention consent--of parents, guardians, or children. Instead, this statement simply discouraged nontherapeutic experiments with children. The guidelines did not, however, suggest that the practice was completely inappropriate; the subcommittee asserted that "important" research using "harmless" levels of radiation dosage with children was acceptable. The crucial terms important and harmless were left undefined. It seems reasonable to expect that "important" pediatric research would address a significant medical problem affecting children or would explore key aspects of normal human physiology-relevant to health promotion or disease Part II prevention— for which research on children is indispensable. By these standards, the twenty-one nontherapeutic radiation experiments with children whose risks we review in the next section of this chapter could all be said to address important questions relevant to pediatric health care. During the 1944-1974 period, there was an explosion of interest in the use of radioisotopes in clinical medicine and medical research, including pediatrics. The twenty-one research projects we review here include only a small number of all those that were likely conducted. These twenty-one do include, however, every nontherapeutic study that was funded by the federal government and fell into our original group of eighty-one pediatric radiation experiments.
  
  All 21 projects analyzed in detail involve the administration of radioisotopes to children in order to better understand child physiology or to develop better diagnostic tools for pediatric disease. In this respect, the studies supported by the federal government do not differ from those reviewed that had other funding sources. With the exception of the study at the Wrentham school to evaluate protective measures for fallout, none of the 21 experiments reviewed was related to national defense concerns. Seventeen of the twenty-one experiments involved the use of iodine 131 for the evaluation of thyroid function.<sup>[[53]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=345)</sup></sup>
  
- A number of myths surround Walter E. Fernald State School, in which sensational allegations claimed residents who were mentally ill were subject to radiation experiments. However, an independent review found the opposite, "Of significant note is that no research was identified by the Task Force that involved testing the effect of radiation on human beings by introducing radioactive materials purposefully into their bodies to measure or monitor such effects. The nutritional research studies used small amounts of radioactive material as tracer elements to understand how the body functioned or obtained elements from the diet; the Thyroid studies used small to large amounts of tracer materials, also to learn about body functions; and, the so-called Cold War study at Wrentham differed in that the tracer materials were used to find the point at which administration of iodine blocked the uptake of radioactive materials that would be found in nuclear fallout." Further, it will be stated that many of the people who became residents of the Walter E. Fernald School, from its opening in 1848 right through the 1950s, were not admitted with a diagnosis of mental retardation. Societal and cultural norms of the day permitted persons to be admitted to state-operated institutions for a number of reasons. All were labeled mentally retarded just by virtue of having lived within the facility. The Task Force asks that the general public and members of the press take special note that these labels are grossly inaccurate, misleading, and simply not true.<sup>[[54]](https://ia902209.us.archive.org/31/items/reportonuseofrad00mass/reportonuseofrad00mass.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[55]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222994/)</sup></sup>
  
- The Tuskegee experiment,1932. This has been subject to a lot of disinformation and popular myth. I'll quote at length from a 2005 Lancet Infectious Diseases article that corrects the distorted record on the episode<sup>[[56]](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(05)01286-7/fulltext)</sup></sup>: "Between 1932 and 1972, the US Public Health Service (USPHS) studied 600 black men, 399 with untreated latent syphilis and 201 uninfected controls, living around Tuskegee, Macon County, Alabama. Although there was no study protocol, the purpose of the Tuskegee experiments seems to have been to observe patients with untreated latent syphilis to autopsy and verify the presence or absence of syphilitic destructive lesions. According to a detailed analysis of the Tuskegee study by Robert M White in Archives of Internal Medicine, USPHS officers believed that the study “should forever dispel the rather general belief that syphilis is a disease of small consequence to the negro”. Many aspects of the conduct of the Tuskegee study are beyond dispute. The men who took part were not told their diagnosis and were misled into believing they were receiving treatment, when in fact most were never adequately treated, even when penicillin became available. However, a pervasive myth that must be dispelled is that patients were deliberately infected with syphilis. The truth is that the infected men had had syphilis for several years at the time they were recruited. It is debatable whether the study was racist. All the patients and controls were black (as was 82% of the population of Macon County in 1930), but this was because the study has its origins in earlier work supported by the philanthropic Rosenwald Fund, with the motivation of promoting the welfare of African Americans. Although the Rosenwald Fund decided not to support the Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis, it was endorsed by the Tuskegee Institute—an entirely African-American organisation—and black health-care professionals were involved at all stages of the study. Indeed, as late as 1969, the Macon County Medical Society, consisting mostly of black doctors, agreed to assist the USPHS in continuing the study.

  To describe the Tuskegee study as unethical requires an element of what Richard A Shweder describes as “presentism” (ie, judging past actions on the basis of the standards of today). When the study began, the only treatment for syphilis was the poorly efficacious arsphenamine compounds, and there was no medical consensus on the usefulness of these drugs in latent syphilis. And debate over whether treatment of latent syphilis did more harm than good continued into the early 1950s, well into the era of penicillin availability. We should also bear in mind that in the 1930s there were no written standards for experimentation with human beings, and the paternalistic attitude that pervaded medical practice at the time meant that the norms for informing patients about their illness were very different from now. Therefore, it is hard to imagine that a hypothetical institutional review board of the 1930s would have judged the Tuskegee study unethical at its inception. However, principles for research with human beings were adopted by the American Medical Association in 1946, and by the 1950s programmes for penicillin treatment of syphilis were widespread across the USA. Thus, by its 20th anniversary the Tuskegee study had become unethical by the standards of the time—patients should have been informed of their diagnosis and given the option of treatment."<sup>[[57]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/224795)</sup></sup> <sup>[[58]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2568733/pdf/jnma00185-0122.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[59]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1043659608314196)</sup></sup>
